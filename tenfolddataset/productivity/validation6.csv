I’ve since used it as a weekly and monthly planner making organizing classes so much easier. I love that I can have all my class notes and planners all in one spot. It’s easy to navigate through as well. The formatting for taking notes makes it easy to follow along in class without having to worry about organizing my notes. I use the class notes template and there’s even a section for questions which I’ve found very helpful as I tend to think of things during lecture but usually at inappropriate times. This template allows me to quickly jot down thoughts so I can ask the professor after class. I’ve only just started to use this app but I’m sure I’ll be using this note taking app well into graduate school. I had to use cengage for one of my college classes and it offered a 6month free trial and after trying to redeem that I ended up being charged for the full annual price. I reached out to customer service and got a response almost immediately with a refund and they honored the free trial as well.

It’s unique recording feature is perfect for lecture notes, and so I decided to give it a full month test, switching from another very well known note taking app and using Notability exclusively. The result, now that the month’s experiment has concluded, is that I’m switching back to the other app. Leaving aside all the countless comparisons and contrasts between these two apps, the deal breaker for me was that Notability’s syncing between iPhone, iPad, and Mac is awful. Any imported big file would only sync to one device, never appearing on all three. PDF imports were the worst—I would check literally DAYS later for a given pdf file to appear on ALL of my devices, only to have it stuck on the one device I originally imported it from. The only way to finally get some files to sync was to delete the Notability app and reinstall it, and even then it was only successful some of the time. As you might imagine, that workaround was beyond disappointing—it was incredibly inconvenient and completely untenable.Don’t get me wrong: Notability is still a very worthwhile purchase. There’s a lot to like about the features and its ease of use, and I’ll definitely be keeping it as my backup. And I’ll still use it whenever I need to combine note taking with recordings.

Sync has become extremely unreliable; I’ve had my edits wiped out by sync failures. As of now, Evernote isn’t letting me move my notes to different notebooks, due to some inexplicable bug. Very helpful features that provide flexibility to working on and organizing notes have been eliminated, I guess in the name of tidiness: opening multiple main windows, changing the created date (so helpful for arranging the notes in the order I want), magnifying the words in the editing window (which now cannot be done without magnifying everything else, making it unreasonably cumbersome to operate the sidebar). Then there are countless bugs throughout the software that keeps giving you frustrating surprises. The recent major upgrade demonstrates the team's disregard for the working habits of established users, and also raises concerns about quality control. In so many respects the new version simply isn't ready, and it's unclear to me why the company would be in a rush to release an update. An option for reverting to the older version would be much, much appreciated. Right now, I do not recommend Evernote to any new user.

Wanted to take the time to write a review for an app I use every day of my life as a medical student. I love every amenity of this app. With my experience, I would like to give the developers a few ideas about how to further improve it. - A quicker color picker would be lovely. For example, being able to place 2-3 Favorite Colors at the top of the screen on the ribbon (1 tap is all we need)! Similar (but better) than having a physical pen with 4 different colored inks. - Another option would be to long-press with our finger/Apple pencil on a color on the screen to switch to that color. Both methods of integration would be awesome. The concept of Longpressing would need a time threshold before it accepts the input as such, so a slider in milliseconds would be ideal. I recommend this for the “Shapes Detection” option also (because we hesitate sometimes..). - Gestures would be nice too! One that immediately comes to mind is double tapping = undo. - On my MacBook and iPad, the Text Box is a little wonky. It assumes I want the box to be a certain width and doesn’t automatically format my text within it. Some tweaks (or advice?) on that may be necessary..These are just quality of life adjustments I have noticed would really make the app absolutely perfect.

Need to have a better navigation support for pdf (textbooks). Annotating a pdf paper is no problem, but reading a 500-page long textbook can be a little painful in terms of navigating. Would be great if can support (recognize and could customize) outlines/super links. Also a thumbnail view support will be super helpful for a quick navigation and overview of the book.2. Need to have a better file management such as allow nested “dividers”. I need to read a lot of scientific papers on different topics and I want to store them accordingly.

I use it extensively, and have always found it easy to use.  However, the new version just updated to my iPad and I am so unhappy.  First of all, it is S-O-O-O S-L-O-W.  It takes forever to open the app, and once open, forever to open a Note.  I post a lot of articles from webpages or the Flipboard app, and in the previous version of Evernote, these appeared immediately to my list of notes.  I just sent a short article to Evernote from Flipboard that took 22 minutes to load.  Evernote just showed it in the Notes list with a spinning wheel of death.  Man, I hate it when software engineers turn something that worked well and that I enjoyed using into something that just aggravates and annoys me.  What a pity this has happened to Evernote.  Afternote:  in the tag list, the A-Z index has been removed, so to skip from Apple to Zebra tags requires scrolling through the entire tag list.

Sometimes if I tap the note to edit it, Evernote launches its embedded browser (which is ridiculously slow). But other times when I tap the note, it goes into editing mode and there aren’t any options to navigate to the original webpage. I use Evernote to reference recipes several times a week, and I had to stop using my phone for that task. Instead, I search for the recipe using Google on my laptop because it’s faster.

All in all, the divider and subjects organization that is in place is too simplistic. I cannot recommend this app to someone who is doing most (potentially all) their school work on it. It just doesn’t have enough organization. Another issue is when you go to send a file to notability, it brings up a ton of subjects, all the subjects you have ever created.

I was willing to excuse it the first two times, but after having another few hours of my life wasted, enough is enough. It’s unbelievable that the app does not even store the notes locally on my device. Notability appears to act as though I never wrote the notes in the first place. To any students out there. Look for a different note taking app. Notability is great when it actually works, but you don’t want to take the risk of having it fail on you. I’m currently exploring other options.","I still have 100+ GB of space, as well as 50+ GB iCloud.",1,True,efficiency,space,25.0,30.0,positive,3

There is one really frustrating thing from pages that made me try this out though. Outlining. Pages doesn’t recognize what you’ve done before like Microsoft. - at least in the ipad apps. So if you need to go past 1. , A., a. You’re stuck. The ruler and tabs in Pages are also garbage, so if you need to do a quick professional outline, get this for a day. But if Ipad is your sole computer - just use something else. Major corporations like Microsoft and Adobe switching to subscription only payment systems is bad for consumers. They have an industry standard hold on the market and therefore can do whatever they want. Luckily smaller companies are popping up - also Apple’s free products, but the lack of customizability is terrible on the iPad in general. Still feels like monopoly to me.",You can’t edit paragraph styles or save templates.,2,True,effectiveness,graph,20.0,25.0,negative,2

When I load the app, the splash screen that shows the Gmail logo *does* have a dark background. But once it loads my emails, it’s just the plain old bright white. I’ve checked in the settings within the app and there is no “Theme” option to be found, so that’s not it. I’ve tried turning the system-wide dark mode off and then on again, force-quitting Gmail, turning the phone off and on again, etc. Nothing works. It’s very frustrating. I like the app otherwise, but the inability to have dark mode working is a big negative.","I’ve tried turning the system-wide dark mode off and then on again, force-quitting Gmail, turning the phone off and on again, etc.",3,True,usability,dark mode,36.0,45.0,negative,7

I actually first discovered Forest through the free Chrome extension and fell in love with it! I had planted so many trees that it was to the point where I was like, okay, time to get the app. I haven't regretted it! I even just got the 21 day coin booster, which is also well worth the extra $2. Instead of getting 43 coins for my regular 2-hour sessions, I get triple that amount for a great price! I wouldn't even mind paying a few extra dollars to make the booster permanent, if that was an option. I also love that it syncs to my laptop. In the chrome version I can block off certain websites while my tree is growing so I can stay on task, which I definitely need. I'm a full-time homeschool student and it is SO easy to get distracted, but with this app I just can't risk letting my little tree die!

I set up a subscription that would charge me monthly, but whenever I would try to use the app, it would say that I had no subscription with that email. It then gave me an option to sign up for a subscription through the App Store, and when I did, it says I already have one with that email. My subscription is also shown to be present on the App Store. So if I’m subscribed and going to be paying money to use this app, why does the app say I’m not? It made the app completely useless.

Being able to use it free on only two devices is annoying, but not a deal-breaker.The scrolling, cursor, and pop up box  (copy, cut, paste, etc) movement drags. It's not exactly a lag. It's almost like a hover. I see this sort of thing a lot on websites, where they work well, but I don't need this fancy addition in my note-taking app. In landscape mode, the pop up box now covers up the text I select because the keyboard is so big (I have an iPhone SE).Also, in switching from portrait to layout and back, it doesn't keep your place.

On the one hand, I use it every single day on my iPad. I do a lot of reading/research for my job, so Notability has saved me from being buried under an endless pile of paper. I even pair it up with Scanbot so I can quickly scan materials in meetings and then have all my notes/handouts in a single place. Being able to search my handwriting is a game-changer! So is having access to my documents and notes everywhere, including my laptop, and having all changes and edits synced through iCloud. I’ve always wanted to go paperless with ubiquitous access to everything; Notability is my hub for that. Which brings me to my chief complaint about Notability: it’s iPhone app is terrible. It’s nice to see my notes on my phone if I need to skim something quickly on the go, but basic functionality is missing. You can’t search a document, highlight pages, see all the pages in a document—if you’re looking for something, you can only scroll until you find it. That’s ok if you’re talking about two pages of notes; but if you are looking at a 50 page journal article trying to find something, it’s ridiculous. Competitors have this functionality on iPhones, but Notability has never added it. I wish they would! I also wish they would format text-only notes like Google Docs, adjusting text size for a given display without affecting the formatting.","I also wish they would format text-only notes like Google Docs, adjusting text size for a given display without affecting the formatting.",4,True,effectiveness,text,31.0,35.0,positive,2

These limits both came as a surprise (it’s 2018) and they became obvious 10 minutes after buying the app. I should have stuck with Todoist.

Disregard for user habits,"I have been a loyal customer with 9000+ notes and 5+ years of premium subscription. The recent overhaul has introduced so many bugs and ridiculous design failures which are forcing me to consider alternative services. Sync has become extremely unreliable; I’ve had my edits wiped out by sync failures. As of now, Evernote isn’t letting me move my notes to different notebooks, due to some inexplicable bug. Very helpful features that provide flexibility to working on and organizing notes have been eliminated, I guess in the name of tidiness: opening multiple main windows, changing the created date (so helpful for arranging the notes in the order I want), magnifying the words in the editing window (which now cannot be done without magnifying everything else, making it unreasonably cumbersome to operate the sidebar). Then there are countless bugs throughout the software that keeps giving you frustrating surprises. The recent major upgrade demonstrates the team's disregard for the working habits of established users, and also raises concerns about quality control. In so many respects the new version simply isn't ready, and it's unclear to me why the company would be in a rush to release an update. An option for reverting to the older version would be much, much appreciated. Right now, I do not recommend Evernote to any new user.

If I create a note with a table and add an image to a cell in that table, the image will disappear after a few minutes and I will be left with an empty table. Last week I learned of I sort one folder by title, it will sort all folders by title.  This is a bad defaul feature, with no way to turn it off that I can find, so I just have to constantly re-sort notes when I switch folders. Furthermore, I’ve gotten into the habit of syncing on one device and when I move to another device, shutting Evernote down completely on the new device before opening any note, because I have had older notes overwrite newer notes before and I don’t know why.

This is very annoying since my file is of 98 pages. Then I should pull down the scroll bar to the bottom of the document. This happens very often, especially when in Mobile view. The second thing is about the page loading steps or speed. By moving down the scroll bar the pages are loaded incrementally. But it has too many steps to the bottom page. Scrolling down the bar to the bottom of the screen loads pages a little. I couldn’t find a good way to jump to the bottom page at once. And this happens in Mobile view. The third frustrating thing is the reaction speed is not just slow, it’s really slow. When I type a character, say A, that appears in the screen after about 0.3~0.5s. This issue also has something to do with Mobile view, I think. The fourth is about moving the cursor with a long-touch. This not only related to Word but to all the other Office 365 applications I guess. This app adopting the obsolete way shows a convex glass  that zoom-in around the cursor when I long-touch the screen. Apple changed the way it moves the cursor since iOS 13 if I’m right.

To search properly you have to use search language which requires a lot of extra typing. This version had made tags worthless as you either have to keep entering searches with each tag or you enter a  keyword and a list of tags that include that keyword pops up but you can only select one tag at a time. Everything  takes more clicks to find something, do something, or import something.   They have also removed the ability to assign tags in the web clipper.  Not sure of what they had in mind with this update, but this version is worthless for my purposes.  I have over 2000 recipes in a notebook which are organized by tags.  By removing the clipper ability to assign tags and the search filter by multiple tags this is pretty useless.  Any suggestions on a replacement? Is there a way to restore to old version?

I use its desktop and iOS apps for nearly everything in my work and personal life. It is a wonderful tool.That said, Evernote is falling further and further behind its competition. The app is incredibly buggy and is in desperate need of a modernization and overhaul. Evernote has been promising this for years, but I wonder if that day will ever come. The current version in iOS 13.2 has one major bug that makes it *incredibly* difficult to use. If you are working in/on a note and move away from it for any amount of time—say to read an email, copy content from a web browser, or your auto-lock kicks in—you lose your place when you return to Evernote. At best, EN reloads your note and takes you to the top of the note when you return to it. At worst, EN takes you back to the “all notes” list where you have you navigate back to the note you were working in and find your place. This goes against all principles of basic multi-tasking and is a major productivity killer.

It's mostly good, and I really like being able to tap directly into Gmail's powerful search capabilities. However, the UI changes I’ve seen on my iPad in recent updates has me reluctant to update my iPhone app.First, the handful of buttons on the left side of the iPad version wastes valuable horizontal screen space. You can see this clearly in the first screenshot currently shown on Gmail's App Store page. Below those buttons there's a strip of never-used white space that could otherwise be used for a wider messages list.My second UI complaint is with the messages list itself. Referring back to that same screenshot, I don't know how they got it to show all that information! Maybe it's the jumbo-sized iPad. On my 9.7"" screen, I rarely see the full subject line (it disappears into a ""...""), and the list of senders involved in a thread often disappears into a ""..."" as well. This makes it really frustrating to scan the list of emails for basic information. If those aforementioned side buttons were moved elsewhere, that strip of unused space on the left could be conscripted to make much of that more visible.Bottom line: I find the app really useful, but some UI optimizations could make it a much better place to manage email without resorting to the desktop app!",My second UI complaint is with the messages list itself.,4,True,effectiveness,list,45.0,49.0,negative,2

None of its competitors offers the same combination of selective note sharing, table creation and editing, and text formatting.Yet there are still quirks. Newly edited notes take a surprising amount of time to be saved, or must be saved manually - if you aren't careful about this and the note is later edited in another device, new versions of the note are created or sometimes appended to the end of the current note without warning you. Evernote on the Mac can change the font in notes, but not on iOS, and sometimes routine copy/pasting on iOS results in text with bizarre fonts that can't be fixed on that device.

However with the latest updates, the app keeps closing on me at random times so I lose my most recent updates on my notes and my recordings. I hope this issue gets fixed soon.Some suggestions on how notability could be improved,1. Everyone uses powerpoint. If there are slides in a powerpoint that I don’t have I want to be able to take a picture quickly and have it come out in decent quality. OneNote has that amazing feature where as you take a photo of a slide, it automatically is able to resize and realign the photo so that it’s not all crooked. Currently right now, I have to download an app that does that for me so it would be nice if notability could add that feature.2. Having some free/blank space on the side where I can make additional notes so that I don’t have to write on my powerpoint slides. Sometimes the slides have too much material and it feels clustered to have to squeeze my notes onto it so it would be awesome if I could have space on the side to add notes. Maybe consider adding ways to insert different types of documents?3. Add more highlighting/drawing options. What I mean by this is, maybe besides just drawing lines you can add rectangles or circles.

As I prepared for a multi-day hike in the remote (and offline) backcountry, I took extensive notes in Evernote. The day before I left, I updated my phone.I got to the trailhead, and loaded the note Id l’d worked on for days. Not on phone. It had been there last night!Evernote decided to upgrade its users with an upgrade that can’t read the already-downloaded notes. So I’m standing at the trailhead without my prepaid permit for the hike, the list of waypoints for my trip, detailed maps, notes on specific sites to visit, excerpts from others’ trip reports etc.Thanks Evernote!Oh and more fun. When I got home I looked at the new app and it still allows offline notebooks. But you can’t force them to download “more” – the help just says it can take “some time” and gives no means of prioritizing. It does not download in any sensible order I can see, like most recent, or default notebook first.Right now my data is held hostage on the Evernote server until they decide to give it to me.I guess the old business model is back... maybe they will allow me to retrieve it faster if I pay an additional fee?","It does not download in any sensible order I can see, like most recent, or default notebook first.",1,True,effectiveness,notebook,84.0,92.0,negative,2

However, these two added benefits do not compensate for the lack of overall usability and functionality. A few of my complaints:-it is insanely challenging to schedule reoccurring events. With Wunderlist and Todoist I could just type “send monthly reports on the second Tuesday of every month” and it would automatically schedule it, or I could say “do blah blah tomorrow” and it would schedule it. This was the nicest feature that I would think a 50 dollar app would have-you can’t create due dates for subtasks.

I schedule a reoccurring event and make it due a certain day, and although it shows up on that day, you can’t check it off so I don’t know if I’ve done it yet.

Have been a user almost ever since notability was published many years ago. Also tried GoodNotes and PDF expert, but for my purposes, notability is the best in terms of ease of use (very intuitive and convenient and perfect Apple Pencil support) and better handwriting rendering.Two possible improvements:1. Need to have a better navigation support for pdf (textbooks). Annotating a pdf paper is no problem, but reading a 500-page long textbook can be a little painful in terms of navigating. Would be great if can support (recognize and could customize) outlines/super links. Also a thumbnail view support will be super helpful for a quick navigation and overview of the book.2. Need to have a better file management such as allow nested “dividers”. I need to read a lot of scientific papers on different topics and I want to store them accordingly. So I created “subjects” underneath “divider” called “papers” like: “genetics-general”, “genetics-asd”, “genetics-gwas”, ..., “machine learning- general “, “machine learning-nn” etc etc ... it’s very inconvenient.Other than the above two potential improvements, notability is perfect for my daily use.

You can’t even change the font color. So, things I need to do at work and things I need to do at home aren’t easily and quickly visually distinguishable when looking at my day. This is a big set back from Things 2.2.

You can search your own handwriting (don’t have to convert it to text), can import and export files (images, screenshots, PDFs, MS Word, etc.) all with extreme ease (this works incredibly with airdrop). I also love being able to switch between notes, have multiple notes open on one screen, and having my favorite writing utensils saved as a toolbar. The backup/sync works very well. I absolutely love being able to cut out and move around/paste my handwriting, it makes super neat notes that are simple to organize and clean up if you do make mistakes while writing. All of this allows me to take notes instead of typing, with all the ease and perks of electronic files. The only thing I would like to see is an option to not layer the highlighter if you lift your pen.

It became a procrastination tool. I could spend an hour entering dates, setting up filters, and customizing views only to realize at the end of that time that I hadn’t actually gotten anything done. In contrast, Things 3 is wonderfully simple and clarifying. It’s as powerful as my previous app, but it strips out all the distractions and the fussiness, leaving pure, easy-to-access essentials: tagging, scheduling & project organizing. The scheduling feature has been the real game changer for me. The app tracks due dates (if you have them) but—more importantly— you can also add a schedule date for each task. The interface makes it very easy to add, move, & view tasks in the schedule (while keeping due dates fixed). So you can plan your time (and easily rearrange that plan as needed). If you’re a GTD person, you can still use that methodology with Things 3 projects & tags. But I find that I do better by adding the accountability of a scheduled list of things that I want to get done on a particular day or in a particular week. Things 3 helps me organize and manage that schedule better than anything else I’ve found. And it gives me the powerhouse organization tool I need without sucking me down a rabbit hole of customization options.","The interface makes it very easy to add, move, & view tasks in the schedule (while keeping due dates fixed).",5,True,usability,due date,92.0,100.0,positive,7

I lead weekly mentoring small groups, so I make notes on Notability for MacBook and then view them on my iPad 4. The whole reason I’ve used Notability is that it’s been so easy to sync notes to my iPad. Sadly, this is no longer an option. The most recent version of Notability available for my perfectly functioning iPad 4(Notability version 8.4.7, iPad IOS version 10.3.3) is now apparently too old to sync with Notability for Mac (Notability version 4.1.3). When I try to open on my iPad a Notability file that was made on my Mac, I get an error saying “This note was created using a newer version of Notability that is not compatible with this version. Please upgrade Notability to open this note.”Very disappointing. Will sadly need to find another note taking platform if this isn’t fixed, because the syncing and compatibility between laptop and iPad is the whole reason I’ve used this app. Please help!!

I would have rated Evernote 5 stars before this problem began.And may I second another reviewer and beg or plead if absolutely necessary for you to PLEASE fix the problem with a note AS WELL AS EVERNOTE closing completely the moment your screen times out. I also store recipes in Evernote, and it is so frustrating to have to reopen the app, reopen the recipe, and then find where you left off multiple times. Also when writing documents, if you let the phone screen time out, boom you have to reopen the app, reopen the document, and find where you left off. Terrible waste of time.

However, with one of the recent updates, they changed the file importing process. Previously, you’d hit something in the top right corner to send to notability and a check mark with “Done” would appear. Switch to notability and a pop up appears asking you where you’d like to put that note.Now, you do this before switching to notability. The process involves many more presses, especially if you want to combine the file with a note. It’s just cumbersome in my opinion. A simple solution would be to revert the changes. Alternatively it could remember which note you were using last for combining files. Currently you have to scroll through an alphabetical list to find the note you want to combine the new one with. It’s much worse than the old splash screen that simply said “combine with current note.”Normally I don’t leave reviews, but this has been a frustrating change with the user experience that slows things down instead of speeding them up.",Currently you have to scroll through an alphabetical list to find the note you want to combine the new one with.,2,True,usability,list,54.0,58.0,negative,7

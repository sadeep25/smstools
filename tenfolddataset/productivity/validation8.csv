Past that, it’s really fallen behind on the times. It’s just not very good at taking notes. Every little aspect of the note taking process is limited or tedious. It’s time for there to be live/instant as you type saving of notes. Also, sharing is a joke. No collaboration. No commenting. Annotations haven’t been updated in years and are basically useless on images and somewhat helpful on PDF’s. It has some of the worst outline note taking features out there. Lastly, it’s time to be able to record a meeting and have time synced notes that other users can comment and/or collaborate on. Seriously, sharing is useless.So why do I still use it?  Scan, clip or photo anything and everything and all the text in those images becomes searchable making it super easy to use Evernote as a big file dumpster and add a reminder to that note and you may not forget to renew your car registration.","Lastly, it’s time to be able to record a meeting and have time synced notes that other users can comment and/or collaborate on.",2,True,compatibility,sync,64.0,68.0,positive,0

Even when you use their free service, they limit the possibilities of the app, and how much you can post within a month. You can't sync across devices which immediately lead me to uninstall this app. Everything this platform does is trying to get you to steal your money. They need to impress me before I start giving them a whopping $70 that I could be using for thick notebooks, food, tools, anything else this app probably can't do.I gave this a chance back in 2015 and regretted it, and I'm regretting it again. I don't care how incredible this app's features are, Evernote's team needs to understand that not everyone is rich enough to throw 70 dollars (EVERY YEAR) at an app that just writes stuff down.

Concerning to say the least. - Recordings keep getting lost or scrambled due to crashes. - OH THE CRASHES!- And countless more.....The app is not 100% ready for iOS 13 and it’s extremely annoying.

Where's the support for attaching from other cloud services? Google drive is the only option. 3) not enough control over notifications. I'd like to be able to mute all email notifications except for messages that come from a certain person or are sent to a certain label (Google's name for inbox subfolders). Instead, the options for notifications are: all new mail, primary only or none. Why not give us more control? I only want to be notified of an email from my immediate family and a handful of others. Besides them everyone else can kindly wait until I choose to actively check my own email. I'd rather not be bombarded with constant notifications on my phone, tablet and watch for promotions, newsletters, etc..

One thing I’ve tried doing this semester is have the recording function on while at a lecture, but having numerous recordings in a file that grows daily is difficult with the current set up. If you don’t remember the time stamp or recording number for a particular point, you have to guess and listen for a bit to see if it’s right. It’s either that, or guess based on the date the notes were recorded. If you could at least rename the audio files, the app would be more useful. It would also be nice if you could change the paper style of individual pages, as well as a feature that easily allows you to draw geometric shapes (adding a figure on top of a graph sticky or any other element get tricky when you click on the wrong one. Sometimes because of that, the graph background ends up on top, and the figure behind it, rendering it useless).There aren’t really any visible bugs with this version of the app, Would recommend for someone looking for a suitable note taking app, whether it’s handwritten or type. I think the addition of a few features would make it better.","If you could at least rename the audio files, the app would be more useful.",4,True,usability,audio,34.0,39.0,negative,7

What seem like relatively benign bugs take on outsized importance when they don’t get fixed for months, and they are crippling on an app as essential as Word. For example: Copy and paste? Can’t do it anymore (at least on an iPad Pro). That seems like essential functionality for a word processor, but apparently that’s not high up on Microsoft’s to do list for bug fixes. Another example: a bit harder to describe, but I have to try anyway. I have all sorts of problems with opening documents from the iOS Files app. I often can’t edit them at all, and instead have to open Word and go through the document picker. When I am able to work on a document, I can’t do things like italicize the font, or add a footnote. The app becomes mostly unresponsive (though I can still scroll and type). So yeah, what I’m basically saying is that it’s so buggy now, you can’t actually process words. It’s terrible.

All this is great for simple handwritten sketches and annotations.More complex operations with graphics allow drawing straight lines, and placing text in arbitrary locations on the page, but both of these could be improved:The tool provides a way to draw a straight line, but it is awkward and not easy to use: to do that you draw a line by hand and then pause at the end of the line for a second. I wish the app would provide another “straight line” tool like most other drawing and desktop publishing apps, so selecting it will make all lines straight.Handling text annotations is also awkward if you want the text placed in specific locations. The placed text requires different handling for moving, copying and deleting. The tools that allow you to delete, copy and move drawn lines do not work on text. Instead, it has it’s own set of operations (for example, to delete, you pause on it with the pencil, then apply another click which opens up a menu - not easy or intuitive).

Wanted to take the time to write a review for an app I use every day of my life as a medical student. I love every amenity of this app. With my experience, I would like to give the developers a few ideas about how to further improve it. - A quicker color picker would be lovely. For example, being able to place 2-3 Favorite Colors at the top of the screen on the ribbon (1 tap is all we need)! Similar (but better) than having a physical pen with 4 different colored inks. - Another option would be to long-press with our finger/Apple pencil on a color on the screen to switch to that color. Both methods of integration would be awesome. The concept of Longpressing would need a time threshold before it accepts the input as such, so a slider in milliseconds would be ideal. I recommend this for the “Shapes Detection” option also (because we hesitate sometimes..). - Gestures would be nice too! One that immediately comes to mind is double tapping = undo. - On my MacBook and iPad, the Text Box is a little wonky. It assumes I want the box to be a certain width and doesn’t automatically format my text within it. Some tweaks (or advice?) on that may be necessary..These are just quality of life adjustments I have noticed would really make the app absolutely perfect.

Recently my transcribed notes on lectures are not being saved and hours of podcasting have been erased. I tried to contact notability for the past 6 months and they keep telling me “I’m so sorry for the long wait of response because we are getting a number of emails” (go figure) and then dont reply to my question. Then someone reply’s with “is your iCloud synced” or something of that sort that is of no help and then a bunch of “sorry” but they dont fix the many issues. I am going to switch my note taking app which I really did not want to do. Only because I work really hard to get my notes transcribed and organized and notability has too many errors.

I could store information that I needed to reference later, etc. However it is not what I consider to be a well rounded app. As no app that makes you have to use another is considered all that great. Not being able to create reoccurring reminders is just ridiculous. This is a very basic feature for a task app to have. I simply stopped using the app altogether because I had to use other sources to make tasks and be reminded of especially when they are monthly or weekly repeating. I even periodically login just to see if this feature has been added, it hasn’t. The app really needs updated to meet this basic need, and no emailing repeating tasks to the user is not sufficient at all. As not every one is on their email constantly some only check certain times a day based on their schedules. The whole point of having an app that features task or to do items is to have push notifications for you to get reminded of the task or even projects you need to get done.

I have recommended it to friends and colleagues. I use the handwriting tool almost exclusively for document entries, Note entries during meetings and conferences and rough drawing of diagrams.

Right now I can insert a new page but not insert large amount of information within a page.  2.  Some of my diagrams have long continuous lines.  Right now If I touch one dot on the line it removes the whole thing.  I would like to be able to refine the diagram without removing a whole section.  3. The volume of my saved documents has expanded and I would like to go more and more paperless. I think Notability would work for my goals.

Marking up any documents takes 3x as long due to seconds wasted every time you need to translate from one tool to another.  All elements of marking up are glitchy - text box doesn’t always appear, no erase function (just delete entire edit), stylus writing is clunky, etc.  There is no way I can use this as a substitute for paper copy and hand marking.

A lot of my subjects in school are so complex - with labs and assignments in addition to lecture notes and different subtopics, the ability to make folders within subjects is seriously ESSENTIAL.

This happens even if I switch apps for less then a minute. On top of that, I use Evernote primarily to bookmark webpages, not to clip them. When I open up a note, it’s unclear how to force the app to take me to the original webpage. Sometimes if I tap the note to edit it, Evernote launches its embedded browser (which is ridiculously slow). But other times when I tap the note, it goes into editing mode and there aren’t any options to navigate to the original webpage. I use Evernote to reference recipes several times a week, and I had to stop using my phone for that task. Instead, I search for the recipe using Google on my laptop because it’s faster.

Emails had visual cues, reminders and things related to your calendar had a different layout, etc. Again, it made your inbox easier to organize.There was also the “Done” functionality. Essentially it meant that with one click you could make an email disappear from the main view but it wasn’t deleted. Just moved somewhere else.None of that exists for Gmail.

I’ve been a premium member since 2012. One of my biggest complaints that they still have not addressed is the security issues. Specifically relating to the desktop app. The mobile version allows you to set a time that it automatically logs you out. Unfortunately, the desktop doesn’t. That leaves your content vulnerable to people who wish to access your content without your permission should you step away from your computer and forget to log out. Yes I know I could use a screensaver to achieve a similar layer of security but that blocks me from everything on my computer. I don’t know why this is possible on the mobile app but not in the desktop. Also, Evernote does not allow you to set additional layers of security for notes or notebooks. You can encrypt text in a note but it doesn’t save that password in an admin settings area. So if you forget or lose the password you lose access to your content. These are sloppy and unrefined security issue if you ask me. I believe Evernote should address these issues and by doing so it can add tremendous value to their overall product.","Also, Evernote does not allow you to set additional layers of security for notes or notebooks.",4,True,security,notebook,85.0,93.0,positive,6

It became a procrastination tool. I could spend an hour entering dates, setting up filters, and customizing views only to realize at the end of that time that I hadn’t actually gotten anything done. In contrast, Things 3 is wonderfully simple and clarifying. It’s as powerful as my previous app, but it strips out all the distractions and the fussiness, leaving pure, easy-to-access essentials: tagging, scheduling & project organizing. The scheduling feature has been the real game changer for me. The app tracks due dates (if you have them) but—more importantly— you can also add a schedule date for each task. The interface makes it very easy to add, move, & view tasks in the schedule (while keeping due dates fixed). So you can plan your time (and easily rearrange that plan as needed). If you’re a GTD person, you can still use that methodology with Things 3 projects & tags.

That said, I think it’s time for this app to do far more to really facilitate better focus.The Pomodoro Technique is effective for a lot of people because you can move between productive time and small breaks. The way this app works, however, is that if you want to plant a tree to its full size you need to focus for two hours straight otherwise it dies or you get a small, not as cute looking tree stub. Frankly, I don’t know anyone nowadays who does that. That’s 1/12 of the whole day already. As a student, I need breaks like most people do. Other productivity apps have this option and I think the devs should consider incorporating a Pomodoro Technique option when you decide to focus for longer than 25 minutes.This is frustrating because I slaved away to earn 1000 coins on buying a cute tree that I can’t focus long enough for. To contextualize, you get 5-6 coins per 20min study and the number of coins earned increases the longer you study in one session. You can imagine how many hours I spent with this app to buy a few trees. These days though, the shrubs are clearly more valuable because the focus-time for those is 20 min at most. Please consider incorporating a Pomodoro Technique mechanic. Just to note, I suggested this in-app but received no response which is why I’m finally posting a review.","To contextualize, you get 5-6 coins per 20min study and the number of coins earned increases the longer you study in one session.",3,True,effectiveness,text,7.0,11.0,positive,2

Today and tomorrow would be better, or even add your in box. Nothing scheduled before today is visible on the watch. Useless. The other 2 things I don’t like about Things is you can punch, tap, click, deep press on an item to edit it until you are blue in the face before you hit it just right & the keyboard pops up so you can edit it.  While messing around with that idiocy you can often hit the check box with one tap completing an item. Luckily it wanders over to the log book where it takes 2-3 taps to put it back in today.  Brilliant.  All in all I have tried over and over to like this, but it doesn’t do anything better, and other apps do everything Things does much better, cleaner and more efficiently.

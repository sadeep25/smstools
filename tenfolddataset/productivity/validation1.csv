Below those buttons there's a strip of never-used white space that could otherwise be used for a wider messages list.My second UI complaint is with the messages list itself. Referring back to that same screenshot, I don't know how they got it to show all that information! Maybe it's the jumbo-sized iPad. On my 9.7"" screen, I rarely see the full subject line (it disappears into a ""...""), and the list of senders involved in a thread often disappears into a ""..."" as well. This makes it really frustrating to scan the list of emails for basic information. If those aforementioned side buttons were moved elsewhere, that strip of unused space on the left could be conscripted to make much of that more visible.Bottom line: I find the app really useful, but some UI optimizations could make it a much better place to manage email without resorting to the desktop app!","First, the handful of buttons on the left side of the iPad version wastes valuable horizontal screen space.",4,True,usability,space,102.0,107.0,negative,7

Wanted to take the time to write a review for an app I use every day of my life as a medical student. I love every amenity of this app. With my experience, I would like to give the developers a few ideas about how to further improve it. - A quicker color picker would be lovely. For example, being able to place 2-3 Favorite Colors at the top of the screen on the ribbon (1 tap is all we need)! Similar (but better) than having a physical pen with 4 different colored inks. - Another option would be to long-press with our finger/Apple pencil on a color on the screen to switch to that color. Both methods of integration would be awesome. The concept of Longpressing would need a time threshold before it accepts the input as such, so a slider in milliseconds would be ideal. I recommend this for the ‚ÄúShapes Detection‚Äù option also (because we hesitate sometimes..). - Gestures would be nice too! One that immediately comes to mind is double tapping = undo. - On my MacBook and iPad, the Text Box is a little wonky. It assumes I want the box to be a certain width and doesn‚Äôt automatically format my text within it. Some tweaks (or advice?) on that may be necessary..These are just quality of life adjustments I have noticed would really make the app absolutely perfect.

Any imported big file would only sync to one device, never appearing on all three. PDF imports were the worst‚ÄîI would check literally DAYS later for a given pdf file to appear on ALL of my devices, only to have it stuck on the one device I originally imported it from.

But, as of now I only have 1GB of data on my cellular plan.  I used it all in 3 days! Which is a bummer. I would always be able stretch my 1 GB for a month no problem. So my issue is that when I launch notability on my cell phone when I‚Äôm not on WiFi, I feel like it syncs all my notes, which is a lot.  Some notes contain pictures, audio recordings, and PDF‚Äôs that I markup. This is my question:  Does notability sync all of your notes when you launch the app? If so, this app is useless to me. The whole point of getting this app for me was to be able to access all of my files on my iPhone when I‚Äôm not at home on my Mac.  Or is there a setting where it can only sync recent notes.

On the one hand, I use it every single day on my iPad. I do a lot of reading/research for my job, so Notability has saved me from being buried under an endless pile of paper. I even pair it up with Scanbot so I can quickly scan materials in meetings and then have all my notes/handouts in a single place. Being able to search my handwriting is a game-changer! So is having access to my documents and notes everywhere, including my laptop, and having all changes and edits synced through iCloud. I‚Äôve always wanted to go paperless with ubiquitous access to everything; Notability is my hub for that. Which brings me to my chief complaint about Notability: it‚Äôs iPhone app is terrible. It‚Äôs nice to see my notes on my phone if I need to skim something quickly on the go, but basic functionality is missing. You can‚Äôt search a document, highlight pages, see all the pages in a document‚Äîif you‚Äôre looking for something, you can only scroll until you find it. That‚Äôs ok if you‚Äôre talking about two pages of notes; but if you are looking at a 50 page journal article trying to find something, it‚Äôs ridiculous. Competitors have this functionality on iPhones, but Notability has never added it. I wish they would! I also wish they would format text-only notes like Google Docs, adjusting text size for a given display without affecting the formatting.","So is having access to my documents and notes everywhere, including my laptop, and having all changes and edits synced through iCloud.",4,True,compatibility,sync,113.0,117.0,positive,0

There are a lot of note taking apps on the market. I feel like if you want a quality one, maybe you need to pay for it. So, I purchased this one and Good Notes.

And please beware: that price for the iOS app does not include the desktop app. That‚Äôs a separate charge. You can‚Äôt access it through a browser either. That‚Äôs a huge negative in my opinion. Additionally, sometimes this app will crash (like during iOS updates) and you‚Äôll lose your subjects and dividers. So, there‚Äôs a way to get your subjects back, but you‚Äôre out of luck with your dividers. What does this mean?

I believe in the long run the long run, this will be a win/win for everybody. Unfortunately, they left out a feature that is critical to my and other users‚Äô workflows. My email inbox is my to do list. I only look there to decide what I need to do. Inbox for Gmail engrained this workflow and it is close to flawless. Google suggests to use Tasks for a workaround. This is not close to the same. Now I have to look at two places and triage what is the most important thing to work on.With Inbox, it takes just a couple of clicks to add a reminder. Once saved, it shows up in your inbox in line with the other emails. Or you can set a future date and it will be hidden until that time. The only true workaround I‚Äôve found is to email myself whenever I need a reminder. This takes several more steps (New email, to: me, subject: something to do, Send, when email arrives, click it and snooze until the appropriate time). This takes more effort and feels like a hacky solution.

I could depend on my notes to be available whenever, wherever, and to hold minimal formatting so I could easily copy to websites and publish. It. Was. Awesome. This release of the ios version eliminated printing, an essential element for proper editing of my writing and the best tool for clear communication on creative and practical projects at home and work.

On the one hand, I use it every single day on my iPad. I do a lot of reading/research for my job, so Notability has saved me from being buried under an endless pile of paper. I even pair it up with Scanbot so I can quickly scan materials in meetings and then have all my notes/handouts in a single place. Being able to search my handwriting is a game-changer! So is having access to my documents and notes everywhere, including my laptop, and having all changes and edits synced through iCloud. I‚Äôve always wanted to go paperless with ubiquitous access to everything; Notability is my hub for that. Which brings me to my chief complaint about Notability: it‚Äôs iPhone app is terrible. It‚Äôs nice to see my notes on my phone if I need to skim something quickly on the go, but basic functionality is missing. You can‚Äôt search a document, highlight pages, see all the pages in a document‚Äîif you‚Äôre looking for something, you can only scroll until you find it. That‚Äôs ok if you‚Äôre talking about two pages of notes; but if you are looking at a 50 page journal article trying to find something, it‚Äôs ridiculous. Competitors have this functionality on iPhones, but Notability has never added it. I wish they would!

I have to say- I‚Äôm very disappointed. Cons:1. The Today view in Things 3 now looks like a big cluttered mess because To-Do‚Äôs in different areas aren‚Äôt divided off into different sections. You can‚Äôt even change the font color. So, things I need to do at work and things I need to do at home aren‚Äôt easily and quickly visually distinguishable when looking at my day. This is a big set back from Things 2.2. There‚Äôs a nice new feature to move To-Dos to ‚ÄúThis Evening.‚Äù But, after the end of the day, things that were scheduled for evening, move back to the same cluttered mess with all the other to-do‚Äôs. I‚Äôd really like to see an upgrade that allows scheduled recurring to dos to be created under the ‚Äúthis evening‚Äù heading. For example, I always go to the gym at night. I‚Äôd like that reminder to appear there rather than have to move it every day.   Pros:1. The calendar integration is very well done2. The ability to set alerts/alarms within a to-do is great.

I tried to send a simple business email through it, and it opened my drive, and google docs just to load the thing into my email which the file was already attached to. Also now I cannot even read any of the attachments I am sending to double check if they are correct, I have to open other apps to read a file loaded already on this one. So far after loving the convenience and simplicity of the old version for many years, this new one is absolute garbage. The main problem is I send most of my business emails through my phone because my computer is slow and mainly stays at home, so this extremely hinders my ability for this process because doing this through the phone is just frustrating. So recap, the old version was great and easy to use, the new version took me almost ten minutes to send a paragraph with an attachment to someone I regularly email for work. That includes several emails which sent the wrong attachment because I couldn‚Äôt open it in the app to read it.","So far after loving the convenience and simplicity of the old version for many years, this new one is absolute garbage.",1,True,usability,old version,59.0,70.0,negative,7

I read many reviews and read that it is one of the best softwares to take notes and annotate PDFs. I immediately began using it. Being new to taking notes in the iPad, I frequently found myself arranging my notes, moving around pictures and sentences. This is where the problems started. When I move pictures or text, somehow in other areas, text moves as well. This has caused several times for me to lose information. So frustrating. Otherwise, the app would be great, but this is a huge issue for me. I am surprised this is happening with what I thought was a stable app.","Being new to taking notes in the iPad, I frequently found myself arranging my notes, moving around pictures and sentences.",3,True,usability,picture,100.0,107.0,positive,7

Now in iOS, I can‚Äôt tap just anywhere in a note to put my cursor there. If I scroll from the bottom to the top of the list then tap, I get taken back to where my cursor last was. To type in a section I have to tap one section at a time until my cursor gets to where I want to type. Very annoying and counter intuitive.I will continue to use the app, since I pay for premium, but I hope they fix this issue.","If I scroll from the bottom to the top of the list then tap, I get taken back to where my cursor last was.",4,True,usability,list,47.0,51.0,negative,7

Below those buttons there's a strip of never-used white space that could otherwise be used for a wider messages list.My second UI complaint is with the messages list itself. Referring back to that same screenshot, I don't know how they got it to show all that information! Maybe it's the jumbo-sized iPad. On my 9.7"" screen, I rarely see the full subject line (it disappears into a ""...""), and the list of senders involved in a thread often disappears into a ""..."" as well. This makes it really frustrating to scan the list of emails for basic information. If those aforementioned side buttons were moved elsewhere, that strip of unused space on the left could be conscripted to make much of that more visible.Bottom line: I find the app really useful, but some UI optimizations could make it a much better place to manage email without resorting to the desktop app!","First, the handful of buttons on the left side of the iPad version wastes valuable horizontal screen space.",4,True,usability,space,102.0,107.0,negative,7

Wanted to take the time to write a review for an app I use every day of my life as a medical student. I love every amenity of this app. With my experience, I would like to give the developers a few ideas about how to further improve it. - A quicker color picker would be lovely. For example, being able to place 2-3 Favorite Colors at the top of the screen on the ribbon (1 tap is all we need)! Similar (but better) than having a physical pen with 4 different colored inks. - Another option would be to long-press with our finger/Apple pencil on a color on the screen to switch to that color. Both methods of integration would be awesome. The concept of Longpressing would need a time threshold before it accepts the input as such, so a slider in milliseconds would be ideal. I recommend this for the ‚ÄúShapes Detection‚Äù option also (because we hesitate sometimes..). - Gestures would be nice too! One that immediately comes to mind is double tapping = undo. - On my MacBook and iPad, the Text Box is a little wonky. It assumes I want the box to be a certain width and doesn‚Äôt automatically format my text within it. Some tweaks (or advice?) on that may be necessary..These are just quality of life adjustments I have noticed would really make the app absolutely perfect.

Any imported big file would only sync to one device, never appearing on all three. PDF imports were the worst‚ÄîI would check literally DAYS later for a given pdf file to appear on ALL of my devices, only to have it stuck on the one device I originally imported it from.

But, as of now I only have 1GB of data on my cellular plan.  I used it all in 3 days! Which is a bummer. I would always be able stretch my 1 GB for a month no problem. So my issue is that when I launch notability on my cell phone when I‚Äôm not on WiFi, I feel like it syncs all my notes, which is a lot.  Some notes contain pictures, audio recordings, and PDF‚Äôs that I markup. This is my question:  Does notability sync all of your notes when you launch the app? If so, this app is useless to me. The whole point of getting this app for me was to be able to access all of my files on my iPhone when I‚Äôm not at home on my Mac.  Or is there a setting where it can only sync recent notes.

On the one hand, I use it every single day on my iPad. I do a lot of reading/research for my job, so Notability has saved me from being buried under an endless pile of paper. I even pair it up with Scanbot so I can quickly scan materials in meetings and then have all my notes/handouts in a single place. Being able to search my handwriting is a game-changer! So is having access to my documents and notes everywhere, including my laptop, and having all changes and edits synced through iCloud. I‚Äôve always wanted to go paperless with ubiquitous access to everything; Notability is my hub for that. Which brings me to my chief complaint about Notability: it‚Äôs iPhone app is terrible. It‚Äôs nice to see my notes on my phone if I need to skim something quickly on the go, but basic functionality is missing. You can‚Äôt search a document, highlight pages, see all the pages in a document‚Äîif you‚Äôre looking for something, you can only scroll until you find it. That‚Äôs ok if you‚Äôre talking about two pages of notes; but if you are looking at a 50 page journal article trying to find something, it‚Äôs ridiculous. Competitors have this functionality on iPhones, but Notability has never added it. I wish they would! I also wish they would format text-only notes like Google Docs, adjusting text size for a given display without affecting the formatting.","So is having access to my documents and notes everywhere, including my laptop, and having all changes and edits synced through iCloud.",4,True,compatibility,sync,113.0,117.0,positive,0

There are a lot of note taking apps on the market. I feel like if you want a quality one, maybe you need to pay for it. So, I purchased this one and Good Notes.

And please beware: that price for the iOS app does not include the desktop app. That‚Äôs a separate charge. You can‚Äôt access it through a browser either. That‚Äôs a huge negative in my opinion. Additionally, sometimes this app will crash (like during iOS updates) and you‚Äôll lose your subjects and dividers. So, there‚Äôs a way to get your subjects back, but you‚Äôre out of luck with your dividers. What does this mean?

I believe in the long run the long run, this will be a win/win for everybody. Unfortunately, they left out a feature that is critical to my and other users‚Äô workflows. My email inbox is my to do list. I only look there to decide what I need to do. Inbox for Gmail engrained this workflow and it is close to flawless. Google suggests to use Tasks for a workaround. This is not close to the same. Now I have to look at two places and triage what is the most important thing to work on.With Inbox, it takes just a couple of clicks to add a reminder. Once saved, it shows up in your inbox in line with the other emails. Or you can set a future date and it will be hidden until that time. The only true workaround I‚Äôve found is to email myself whenever I need a reminder. This takes several more steps (New email, to: me, subject: something to do, Send, when email arrives, click it and snooze until the appropriate time). This takes more effort and feels like a hacky solution.

I could depend on my notes to be available whenever, wherever, and to hold minimal formatting so I could easily copy to websites and publish. It. Was. Awesome. This release of the ios version eliminated printing, an essential element for proper editing of my writing and the best tool for clear communication on creative and practical projects at home and work.

On the one hand, I use it every single day on my iPad. I do a lot of reading/research for my job, so Notability has saved me from being buried under an endless pile of paper. I even pair it up with Scanbot so I can quickly scan materials in meetings and then have all my notes/handouts in a single place. Being able to search my handwriting is a game-changer! So is having access to my documents and notes everywhere, including my laptop, and having all changes and edits synced through iCloud. I‚Äôve always wanted to go paperless with ubiquitous access to everything; Notability is my hub for that. Which brings me to my chief complaint about Notability: it‚Äôs iPhone app is terrible. It‚Äôs nice to see my notes on my phone if I need to skim something quickly on the go, but basic functionality is missing. You can‚Äôt search a document, highlight pages, see all the pages in a document‚Äîif you‚Äôre looking for something, you can only scroll until you find it. That‚Äôs ok if you‚Äôre talking about two pages of notes; but if you are looking at a 50 page journal article trying to find something, it‚Äôs ridiculous. Competitors have this functionality on iPhones, but Notability has never added it. I wish they would!

I have to say- I‚Äôm very disappointed. Cons:1. The Today view in Things 3 now looks like a big cluttered mess because To-Do‚Äôs in different areas aren‚Äôt divided off into different sections. You can‚Äôt even change the font color. So, things I need to do at work and things I need to do at home aren‚Äôt easily and quickly visually distinguishable when looking at my day. This is a big set back from Things 2.2. There‚Äôs a nice new feature to move To-Dos to ‚ÄúThis Evening.‚Äù But, after the end of the day, things that were scheduled for evening, move back to the same cluttered mess with all the other to-do‚Äôs. I‚Äôd really like to see an upgrade that allows scheduled recurring to dos to be created under the ‚Äúthis evening‚Äù heading. For example, I always go to the gym at night. I‚Äôd like that reminder to appear there rather than have to move it every day.   Pros:1. The calendar integration is very well done2. The ability to set alerts/alarms within a to-do is great.

So far after loving the convenience and simplicity of the old version for many years, this new one is absolute garbage.

Below those buttons there's a strip of never-used white space that could otherwise be used for a wider messages list.My second UI complaint is with the messages list itself. Referring back to that same screenshot, I don't know how they got it to show all that information! Maybe it's the jumbo-sized iPad. On my 9.7"" screen, I rarely see the full subject line (it disappears into a ""...""), and the list of senders involved in a thread often disappears into a ""..."" as well. This makes it really frustrating to scan the list of emails for basic information. If those aforementioned side buttons were moved elsewhere, that strip of unused space on the left could be conscripted to make much of that more visible.Bottom line: I find the app really useful, but some UI optimizations could make it a much better place to manage email without resorting to the desktop app!",You can see this clearly in the first screenshot currently shown on Gmail's App Store page.,4,True,usability,page,87.0,91.0,positive,7

On the one hand, I use it every single day on my iPad. I do a lot of reading/research for my job, so Notability has saved me from being buried under an endless pile of paper. I even pair it up with Scanbot so I can quickly scan materials in meetings and then have all my notes/handouts in a single place. Being able to search my handwriting is a game-changer! So is having access to my documents and notes everywhere, including my laptop, and having all changes and edits synced through iCloud. I‚Äôve always wanted to go paperless with ubiquitous access to everything; Notability is my hub for that. Which brings me to my chief complaint about Notability: it‚Äôs iPhone app is terrible. It‚Äôs nice to see my notes on my phone if I need to skim something quickly on the go, but basic functionality is missing. You can‚Äôt search a document, highlight pages, see all the pages in a document‚Äîif you‚Äôre looking for something, you can only scroll until you find it. That‚Äôs ok if you‚Äôre talking about two pages of notes; but if you are looking at a 50 page journal article trying to find something, it‚Äôs ridiculous. Competitors have this functionality on iPhones, but Notability has never added it. I wish they would!

When I tried to get around this by saving the doc to the iPad, I found a bug.  I created a doc, saved it to the iPad.  Then I created another doc, saved it to the iPad also.

However, these two added benefits do not compensate for the lack of overall usability and functionality. A few of my complaints:-it is insanely challenging to schedule reoccurring events. With Wunderlist and Todoist I could just type ‚Äúsend monthly reports on the second Tuesday of every month‚Äù and it would automatically schedule it, or I could say ‚Äúdo blah blah tomorrow‚Äù and it would schedule it.

I‚Äôve been a premium member since 2012. One of my biggest complaints that they still have not addressed is the security issues. Specifically relating to the desktop app. The mobile version allows you to set a time that it automatically logs you out. Unfortunately, the desktop doesn‚Äôt. That leaves your content vulnerable to people who wish to access your content without your permission should you step away from your computer and forget to log out. Yes I know I could use a screensaver to achieve a similar layer of security but that blocks me from everything on my computer. I don‚Äôt know why this is possible on the mobile app but not in the desktop. Also, Evernote does not allow you to set additional layers of security for notes or notebooks. You can encrypt text in a note but it doesn‚Äôt save that password in an admin settings area. So if you forget or lose the password you lose access to your content. These are sloppy and unrefined security issue if you ask me.

I didn‚Äôt move over to Mac to use Microsoft storage. I want everything in iCloud because it makes sense to have one unified storage location. Yes, I can still hit file/save every ten minutes - but I shouldn‚Äôt have to deal with that distraction because I paid to get an app that would work on my computer. The inconvenience of this demand is making me consider moving over to all of the apple products. Pages isn‚Äôt that different from Word - in a lot of ways, it‚Äôs even better. So, here‚Äôs my official request, Microsoft. If you‚Äôre going to make people pay for your product, you don‚Äôt get to insist how they use it. Open that feature so we can save to the iCloud!

If there are slides in a powerpoint that I don‚Äôt have I want to be able to take a picture quickly and have it come out in decent quality. OneNote has that amazing feature where as you take a photo of a slide, it automatically is able to resize and realign the photo so that it‚Äôs not all crooked. Currently right now, I have to download an app that does that for me so it would be nice if notability could add that feature.2. Having some free/blank space on the side where I can make additional notes so that I don‚Äôt have to write on my powerpoint slides. Sometimes the slides have too much material and it feels clustered to have to squeeze my notes onto it so it would be awesome if I could have space on the side to add notes. Maybe consider adding ways to insert different types of documents?3. Add more highlighting/drawing options. What I mean by this is, maybe besides just drawing lines you can add rectangles or circles. I know that you can insert figures but I feel like they are out of the way.","However with the latest updates, the app keeps closing on me at random times so I lose my most recent updates on my notes and my recordings.",5,True,efficiency,update,25.0,31.0,negative,3

It's hard to get past the nausea inducing aesthetics. Fewer emails to see at a glance, pointless avatars, ugh, the red! The check box was MUCH more intuitive than the initials/avatar circle that have replaced it. It's simply harder to read and process at a glance. Why did you bury the reply button? Most often, what I want to reply to is at the top. I shouldn't have to scroll down to reply. In general things that were intuitive aren't. It's not my job to figure this stuff out.

The iPad app is amazing for use with Apple Pencil or other styluses, and the fun pen colors and paper choices make notes less boring. This app also works with TONS of file types which you can import and annotate. I have nor used the voice feature yet, but I am thrilled to as I am sure it is as good as everything else this app offers. Finally my favorite feature is that notability automatically saves all my files and updates them constant across all my devices, so I never have to wait for my files to load. The useful feature of backing up the notes to google drive or Dropbox is amazingly helpful and lets me have my notes accessible even when I am not on my own laptop with the app. Overall MUST BUY for college students especially, or anyone who is a frequent note taker or writer.

I‚Äôve used it across platforms and devices and it is seamless. I‚Äôve never had it glitch or not work on each new phone I‚Äôve purchased. At first, I only got it to take notes on the go when I was in military aviation. It helped me keep all unclassified tidbits in one safe space, but then I watched it and my need for it grow both over time and after I left the military for new professional endeavors. Other apps have tried to do something similar with their own novel touches, like Trello which I think is a decent app, but nothing has yet truly rivaled Evernote. Its easy to use and helps busy minds like mine to braindump everything into a tidy new entry while allowing me to build on it and reprioritize the contents along the way. I haven‚Äôt tried linking individuals for a shared group experience, like teams yet, but I am sure it would be a synch. It‚Äôs got pretty much everything you need from simple notes both with text and finger writing to scanning, audio, and video to checklists and more.Now that I am writing a book, it has become my writing research hub both on the go and while sitting at my computer. I open up a new web browser tab on my desktop and do everything I need to do right there with a click of the mouse. That way, I don‚Äôt need to transpose everything I am researching onto my phone a second time. Great app!

This allows spammers to confirm they have an active address and to know your rough location for their databases.Until several months ago, this was a five star app. The last several updates have removed vital functionality. In addition, they seem to be releasing a new update every couple of days with no noticeable changes, in what I can only assume is an attempt to minimize the impact of all be bad reviews (very few of them will then be for the ""current version"").

Very helpful features that provide flexibility to working on and organizing notes have been eliminated, I guess in the name of tidiness: opening multiple main windows, changing the created date (so helpful for arranging the notes in the order I want), magnifying the words in the editing window (which now cannot be done without magnifying everything else, making it unreasonably cumbersome to operate the sidebar). Then there are countless bugs throughout the software that keeps giving you frustrating surprises.

I use its desktop and iOS apps for nearly everything in my work and personal life. It is a wonderful tool.That said, Evernote is falling further and further behind its competition. The app is incredibly buggy and is in desperate need of a modernization and overhaul. Evernote has been promising this for years, but I wonder if that day will ever come. The current version in iOS 13.2 has one major bug that makes it *incredibly* difficult to use. If you are working in/on a note and move away from it for any amount of time‚Äîsay to read an email, copy content from a web browser, or your auto-lock kicks in‚Äîyou lose your place when you return to Evernote.

You can see this clearly in the first screenshot currently shown on Gmail's App Store page. Below those buttons there's a strip of never-used white space that could otherwise be used for a wider messages list.My second UI complaint is with the messages list itself. Referring back to that same screenshot, I don't know how they got it to show all that information! Maybe it's the jumbo-sized iPad. On my 9.7"" screen, I rarely see the full subject line (it disappears into a ""...""), and the list of senders involved in a thread often disappears into a ""..."" as well. This makes it really frustrating to scan the list of emails for basic information. If those aforementioned side buttons were moved elsewhere, that strip of unused space on the left could be conscripted to make much of that more visible.Bottom line: I find the app really useful, but some UI optimizations could make it a much better place to manage email without resorting to the desktop app!",My second UI complaint is with the messages list itself.,4,True,effectiveness,list,45.0,49.0,negative,2

None of its competitors offers the same combination of selective note sharing, table creation and editing, and text formatting.Yet there are still quirks. Newly edited notes take a surprising amount of time to be saved, or must be saved manually - if you aren't careful about this and the note is later edited in another device, new versions of the note are created or sometimes appended to the end of the current note without warning you. Evernote on the Mac can change the font in notes, but not on iOS, and sometimes routine copy/pasting on iOS results in text with bizarre fonts that can't be fixed on that device.

Sync has become extremely unreliable; I‚Äôve had my edits wiped out by sync failures. As of now, Evernote isn‚Äôt letting me move my notes to different notebooks, due to some inexplicable bug. Very helpful features that provide flexibility to working on and organizing notes have been eliminated, I guess in the name of tidiness: opening multiple main windows, changing the created date (so helpful for arranging the notes in the order I want), magnifying the words in the editing window (which now cannot be done without magnifying everything else, making it unreasonably cumbersome to operate the sidebar). Then there are countless bugs throughout the software that keeps giving you frustrating surprises. The recent major upgrade demonstrates the team's disregard for the working habits of established users, and also raises concerns about quality control. In so many respects the new version simply isn't ready, and it's unclear to me why the company would be in a rush to release an update. An option for reverting to the older version would be much, much appreciated. Right now, I do not recommend Evernote to any new user.

This only occurs when I am trying to write and my palm is resting on the lower portion of the screen.  I have had some previous issues with palm rejection, mainly with the shifting of the screen or zoom but it has been manageable up until this update.  It has become basically unusable for me in terms of handwriting since the recent update and the handwriting feature is nearly the sole purpose for purchasing the app in my case.  I‚Äôve basically had to resort to other apps for note taking because this has become nearly impossible to write on (unless I write without my palm on the screen and that is definitely not an alternative for me). After reading the previous comments, I have already performed a hard reset of my iPad (an iPad Pro 11‚Äù on iOS 12.3), turned off the palm rejection feature in Notability and turned it back on, and finally uninstalled the app completely then reinstalled.

Moral: don‚Äôt think this app isn‚Äôt useful because you‚Äôre not at a desk all day. It has countless uses. I agree with what other users have said about gamification being a good motivator, and the user interface is very appealing. Creating and naming tags produces helpful data. For instance, if you‚Äôre concerned about work-life balance, you can see a colorful pie chart with a few simple clicks. One thing: I‚Äôm fine with how the trees become more ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù as time passes. However, it can take a long, long time to gain sufficient coins after awhile. I‚Äôm not asking for instant and easy gratification, because that‚Äôs contrary to the spirit of the app. I think adding more achievement bonuses (that don‚Äôt depend on having friends that use the app or on leaderboard performance) would be great. Unlocking achievements is also rewarding and something to strive for, so I‚Äôd love to see more!","I agree with what other users have said about gamification being a good motivator, and the user interface is very appealing.",5,True,general,interface,97.0,106.0,positive,4

A common one is when I switch from one meeting to another, I close one note and open a new one.  Sometimes the recording function sends a message that the recording is being recovered.  Then, the recording attaches to the new note, so I am beginning a session with an unrelated recording.  Puzzling.A more concerning thing happened yesterday.  A notice on my iMac (2020 vintage) said I needed to update Notability, but when I selected the update option, I received a message that Notability was no longer on the App Store.  Still, the update option message persists.  Is this true?  The OSX version is no longer being updated?  If not, please fix the glitch on the App Store.Recent changes to the recording interface are obscure and perplexing... where are the user instructions?  I bet they exist somewhere, but why-o-why are they not on the web site?

I put all my notes in it instead of using paper. I have always loved this App. Unfortunately, the latest update to this program has made it very frustrating to use.

What‚Äôs frustrating about its latest revision is that every time I hop to another App and come back to Evernote, a circle spins around in the center of my screen and the same note that was open before is refreshed. I think Evernote is syncing and I have to wait until it is finished. This is not how it was before. I believe the syncing should be done only after the App is closed and reopened later. I honestly think this latest change of OVER SYNCING was a bad idea and the program should be changed back to he way it was.

This is very annoying since my file is of 98 pages. Then I should pull down the scroll bar to the bottom of the document. This happens very often, especially when in Mobile view. The second thing is about the page loading steps or speed. By moving down the scroll bar the pages are loaded incrementally. But it has too many steps to the bottom page. Scrolling down the bar to the bottom of the screen loads pages a little. I couldn‚Äôt find a good way to jump to the bottom page at once. And this happens in Mobile view. The third frustrating thing is the reaction speed is not just slow, it‚Äôs really slow. When I type a character, say A, that appears in the screen after about 0.3~0.5s. This issue also has something to do with Mobile view, I think. The fourth is about moving the cursor with a long-touch. This not only related to Word but to all the other Office 365 applications I guess. This app adopting the obsolete way shows a convex glass  that zoom-in around the cursor when I long-touch the screen. Apple changed the way it moves the cursor since iOS 13 if I‚Äôm right.

It was a small annoyance before, but it is happening more and more frequently. Notability likes to lose notes. Many of my peers have problems with this. I lost a weeks worth of notes from notability. Thankfully, I back up to google drive and iCloud. It was present in google drive, but not iCloud. The previous review stands. The problem occurs when people download the iOS app and causes malfunction on the iPad and computer. It is not due to low storage space, as there is plenty of storage space available. Basically, you have to deal with it until it magically stops...or doesn‚Äôt. Why keep using notability? Best we have, so we deal with the bugs. Previous review: Please fix the iCloud sync bug. The app decides to sync all my notes in the middle of class, preventing me from taking notes while the sync is happening. It is also duplicating many notes.

It would also be nice if you could change the paper style of individual pages, as well as a feature that easily allows you to draw geometric shapes (adding a figure on top of a graph sticky or any other element get tricky when you click on the wrong one. Sometimes because of that, the graph background ends up on top, and the figure behind it, rendering it useless).There aren‚Äôt really any visible bugs with this version of the app, Would recommend for someone looking for a suitable note taking app, whether it‚Äôs handwritten or type.

Another thing that I really liked was all of the new updates that really helped with making things run more smoothly (i.e. the favorites bar, being able to search for key words within the notes themselves instead of just the title, and the magnifying glass). Some areas of improvement would be being able to adjust the shape of the magnifying box because there are sometimes when I‚Äôm trying to edit a specific place and the magnifying box just doesn‚Äôt fit right. Another thing would be to be able to open more than two notes at once. This would come in handy for those to do notes simultaneously on multiple sections. It would also be cool if when your in portrait mode for the notes you have the option to be able to stack the notes top of one another instead of seeing them side. Then one last area of adjustment would be to be able to have a bookmarked notes bar like how there is a bookmarked pages (within each notes) bar.

Instead of upgrading Gmail they decided to put a couple minor features into Gmail and leaving the better options such as automatic grouping based on promotional, purchases, etc along with your main mailbox for the information you want to see. What we‚Äôre left with is an inferior product with the look and functionality of 2005 and even include forced advertising in the main mailbox.

It would also be nice if you could change the paper style of individual pages, as well as a feature that easily allows you to draw geometric shapes (adding a figure on top of a graph sticky or any other element get tricky when you click on the wrong one.

The result is that it‚Äôs constantly lagging and in many cases, not syncing or even loading. I‚Äôve just written notes from a 2 hour management meeting which were completely lost because my iPad sleep screen went up and upon awaking my iPad, everything was lost!

There should be an option to add additional pens and highlighters to the toolbar. When rapidly taking notes, time is precious, and this would make it less tedious.2) inserting diagrams is too difficult. There should be a math or shape mode that you can toggle on and off that auto recognizes shapes and fixes them. Having an math text mode that auto recognizes math notation would also be fantastic ... p.s. OneNotes version of this is poorly executed. 3)**** when I record lectures, I am always slightly behind when note taking. If there were an advanced feature where we could choose where the audio track lines up with the notes, that would be spectacular. Revisited notes would be much superior and would be more like sitting through the lecture again.****4) there should be an option to directly add in PDFs to our notes. They could be added in as entire pages to the document, just integrating the PDF, or auto convert to an image to be pasted in. But working with PDFs in existing notes should be an option.","If there were an advanced feature where we could choose where the audio track lines up with the notes, that would be spectacular.",4,True,compatibility,audio,67.0,72.0,positive,0

I run notability on an iPad Pro 2018 updated with iOS 13 beta. Sometimes when transferring text from a PDF in side by side notes (in-app side by side), the note will freeze up. The newly transferred text locks and everything in the note seems corrupted (severe lag, inability to properly use tools, inability to delete said text, etc). Using other devices to access the same file (through cloud) causes the app to crash. Saving grace has been to make a pdf export (to save what is on the file and ‚Äúflatten‚Äù the image) then delete old note and create a new one using the PDF. Of course doing this removes the ability to edit the newly converted PDF notes. Creating a copy or exporting as a notability file just keeps the bug. The bug only happens on occasion but can really stress you out if you have homework due.

The new, jarring, super white look makes my eyes hurt, especially when I have a migraine. With no color separation or clear boundary demarcation, it strains my eyes, if I have to spend any real time checking my email. I no longer use a desktop or laptop computer, so I depend on using the app. The new changes make it almost impossible for me to use, though, because it literally hurts my eyes and causes my vision to blur.Additionally, the placement of the option to change accounts in the previous version made sense. Where it is placed in the new version is not intuitive or user friendly. It now takes extra steps to pull up a separate screen in order to switch between accounts. This means I have to spend additional time on the stark white, visually unappealing app, which literally causes me pain, if I want to check my mail.This is a HORRIBLE update, that does not give any consideration for those with eye strain or vision problems.

I like order and I would like to be able to organize my notes in such a manner that I have large folders then more folders within my folders and so forth. Those are my two major complaints with this app. Overall though, I would recommend, I will definitely get my $10 out of this app.Dropped to one Star because the latest update has messed up the app. It is now glitching a lot and the notes won‚Äôt quit ‚Äúsyncing‚Äù with iCloud so I can‚Äôt access them.

Wanted to take the time to write a review for an app I use every day of my life as a medical student. I love every amenity of this app. With my experience, I would like to give the developers a few ideas about how to further improve it. - A quicker color picker would be lovely. For example, being able to place 2-3 Favorite Colors at the top of the screen on the ribbon (1 tap is all we need)! Similar (but better) than having a physical pen with 4 different colored inks. - Another option would be to long-press with our finger/Apple pencil on a color on the screen to switch to that color. Both methods of integration would be awesome. The concept of Longpressing would need a time threshold before it accepts the input as such, so a slider in milliseconds would be ideal. I recommend this for the ‚ÄúShapes Detection‚Äù option also (because we hesitate sometimes..). - Gestures would be nice too! One that immediately comes to mind is double tapping = undo. - On my MacBook and iPad, the Text Box is a little wonky. It assumes I want the box to be a certain width and doesn‚Äôt automatically format my text within it. Some tweaks (or advice?) on that may be necessary..These are just quality of life adjustments I have noticed would really make the app absolutely perfect.

And then when I finally get a note open (like a recipe, for example), if I switch between Evernote and another app, then Evernote completely restarts and I lose my place and have to search for the note again. This happens even if I switch apps for less then a minute. On top of that, I use Evernote primarily to bookmark webpages, not to clip them. When I open up a note, it‚Äôs unclear how to force the app to take me to the original webpage. Sometimes if I tap the note to edit it, Evernote launches its embedded browser (which is ridiculously slow). But other times when I tap the note, it goes into editing mode and there aren‚Äôt any options to navigate to the original webpage. I use Evernote to reference recipes several times a week, and I had to stop using my phone for that task. Instead, I search for the recipe using Google on my laptop because it‚Äôs faster.

If there are slides in a powerpoint that I don‚Äôt have I want to be able to take a picture quickly and have it come out in decent quality. OneNote has that amazing feature where as you take a photo of a slide, it automatically is able to resize and realign the photo so that it‚Äôs not all crooked.

Having some free/blank space on the side where I can make additional notes so that I don‚Äôt have to write on my powerpoint slides. Sometimes the slides have too much material and it feels clustered to have to squeeze my notes onto it so it would be awesome if I could have space on the side to add notes.

Ultimately, I was very happy with Todoist but upon going into the App Store to update it, I stumbled upon things 3. I was intrigued by the positive reviews and design awards and saw this as an opportunity to improve my productivity (I really liked the fact that it could sync with your calendar and that you could add notes to an event). However, these two added benefits do not compensate for the lack of overall usability and functionality. A few of my complaints:-it is insanely challenging to schedule reoccurring events. With Wunderlist and Todoist I could just type ‚Äúsend monthly reports on the second Tuesday of every month‚Äù and it would automatically schedule it, or I could say ‚Äúdo blah blah tomorrow‚Äù and it would schedule it. This was the nicest feature that I would think a 50 dollar app would have-you can‚Äôt create due dates for subtasks. A lot of times I have a project that is due one day, but I have predecessors that must be completed on days prior, there is no way to arrange this in things (once again, a feature that free competing tools offer)-you can‚Äôt check off reoccurring events!!! This drives me nuts as it seems like such a simple feature. I schedule a reoccurring event and make it due a certain day, and although it shows up on that day, you can‚Äôt check it off so I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve done it yet. And if I don‚Äôt complete it, it just goes away the next day soI don‚Äôt remember to do it. These are just a few of many usability complaints I have.

It has become basically unusable for me in terms of handwriting since the recent update and the handwriting feature is nearly the sole purpose for purchasing the app in my case.  I‚Äôve basically had to resort to other apps for note taking because this has become nearly impossible to write on (unless I write without my palm on the screen and that is definitely not an alternative for me). After reading the previous comments, I have already performed a hard reset of my iPad (an iPad Pro 11‚Äù on iOS 12.3), turned off the palm rejection feature in Notability and turned it back on, and finally uninstalled the app completely then reinstalled.

However, users can‚Äôt alter them inside the notability app, which means that users have to use another app to do so.

A while back they limited the free version to just two devices, so I dropped the iPad for my phone and laptop. I use Evernote for everything - work, personal notes, journal, recipes. Pretty much everything I ever write down goes into Evernote. I have no complaints about the desktop version, however the mobile app has been giving me so much trouble over the last year. It‚Äôs been a lot slower and crashes more often. None of my other phone apps do this, and my phone is running very smoothly, so I know it‚Äôs not the device. The other thing that really bothers me is that notes don‚Äôt stay open when the screen turns off or when you switch apps then switch back to Evernote. For example I use Evernote to store all my recipes, and while I‚Äôm cooking I‚Äôll have the note with the recipe open, and then if I switch to my web browser to look up something, or my phone screen turns off, Evernote closes the note and it goes back to the main screen where all your notes are. This is super tedious and frustrating because then instead of looking at my phone to see what‚Äôs next in the recipe, I have to go back and search for the recipe again. It seems like a minor thing, but I think it‚Äôs pretty basic and should be addressed. If my phone was off for a long period of time I wouldn‚Äôt expect the note to stay open, but it‚Äôs always a matter of minutes if not less than a minute.","A while back they limited the free version to just two devices, so I dropped the iPad for my phone and laptop.",4,True,general,free version,31.0,43.0,negative,4

However, the UI changes I‚Äôve seen on my iPad in recent updates has me reluctant to update my iPhone app.First, the handful of buttons on the left side of the iPad version wastes valuable horizontal screen space. You can see this clearly in the first screenshot currently shown on Gmail's App Store page. Below those buttons there's a strip of never-used white space that could otherwise be used for a wider messages list.My second UI complaint is with the messages list itself. Referring back to that same screenshot, I don't know how they got it to show all that information! Maybe it's the jumbo-sized iPad. On my 9.7"" screen, I rarely see the full subject line (it disappears into a ""...""), and the list of senders involved in a thread often disappears into a ""..."" as well. This makes it really frustrating to scan the list of emails for basic information. If those aforementioned side buttons were moved elsewhere, that strip of unused space on the left could be conscripted to make much of that more visible.Bottom line: I find the app really useful, but some UI optimizations could make it a much better place to manage email without resorting to the desktop app!","However, the UI changes I‚Äôve seen on my iPad in recent updates has me reluctant to update my iPhone app.",4,True,usability,update,56.0,62.0,negative,7

Sometimes I even just see a list of notebooks and need to search for the recipe again.It's far easier to screen shot the recipe and reference that instead.

It has made taking notes fun and easy. And now after using this app for a little over a year and a half, I can absolutely say that this is my favorite note taking app. Practically everything that I do for school is on this app, which when paired to my phone makes it a breeze to quickly scroll through my notes at any time. The writing feels fluid with great options for size and colors. Importing files and documents is extremely easy and fast. On tops of this, the line straitening and shape recognition is amazingly useful and easy, without being intrusive or correcting things that were not meant to be corrected. My one issue I have is with organization. Especially towards the end of the year when I have hundreds of notes and files, they can often be lost in the clutter. I have found ways around this by specifically labeling my files so all of my notes, quizzes, tests, and handouts are all sorted by category alphabetically, but I wish there was a way to put folders inside of subjects. This app is my favorite, but to make it the best it really needs a better way to organize files inside of subjects.

Why do I have to keep clicking different menus to add a specific event time? I need reminded. That's the whole point of buying this. It should be easy and obvious. If this had a trial, I probably wouldn't have bought it.  The integration of the apple default to do list was a big +1 for me, but I can't just use Siri as it says. You use Siri, she ads it to your default list app. Then later you have to hit a button in the tasks app that imports the task. Just auto import!!!

For instance sometimes you want to write down something that just popped in your head. You don‚Äôt want to worry about figuring out then if it‚Äôs a reminder or a To-do or just a note. You don‚Äôt want to worry about setting it for a specific day and a specific time. You just want to quickly jot it down in your To-dos/ reminder/ notes and be able to easily access it and take care of details later.I had given up on my hope of finding an app that would solve this type issue. So for the past few years, I had just been relying on the iOS default note app. I have been using this app now for a few months and it has everything I have ever dreamed of in a To-do/ reminder app. Honestly I am beyond satisfied.

I rely on it to organize notes and recipes, and also to track bookmarked articles that I want to reference later. The most recent iOS update has made the app completely unusable. Every action is painfully slow. It crashes often. And then when I finally get a note open (like a recipe, for example), if I switch between Evernote and another app, then Evernote completely restarts and I lose my place and have to search for the note again. This happens even if I switch apps for less then a minute. On top of that, I use Evernote primarily to bookmark webpages, not to clip them. When I open up a note, it‚Äôs unclear how to force the app to take me to the original webpage. Sometimes if I tap the note to edit it, Evernote launches its embedded browser (which is ridiculously slow). But other times when I tap the note, it goes into editing mode and there aren‚Äôt any options to navigate to the original webpage. I use Evernote to reference recipes several times a week, and I had to stop using my phone for that task. Instead, I search for the recipe using Google on my laptop because it‚Äôs faster. Obviously that totally defeats the purpose of having an app on my phone. I‚Äôve never written an App Store review before, but I‚Äôm so disappointed in this update that I felt compelled to post something.

And it *was* a really awesome app. ...and then, they added paid subscriptions; and those of us who opted not to pay for features we don‚Äôt value were effectively abandoned. Half my notes won‚Äôt load anymore, and the only ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù option you have is the user forum.  Literally every single instruction on their help pages tell you to create a support ticket; but the chat feature is conveniently never available, and the email feature is only available to paid accounts.  Extremely disappointed in the ‚Äúscrew you‚Äù attitude that Evernote seems to have adopted.",I used it for everything from shopping lists to subscription information to the chores my kids are supposed to do.,1,True,effectiveness,,,,positive,2

Ultimately, I was very happy with Todoist but upon going into the App Store to update it, I stumbled upon things 3. I was intrigued by the positive reviews and design awards and saw this as an opportunity to improve my productivity (I really liked the fact that it could sync with your calendar and that you could add notes to an event). However, these two added benefits do not compensate for the lack of overall usability and functionality. A few of my complaints:-it is insanely challenging to schedule reoccurring events. With Wunderlist and Todoist I could just type ‚Äúsend monthly reports on the second Tuesday of every month‚Äù and it would automatically schedule it, or I could say ‚Äúdo blah blah tomorrow‚Äù and it would schedule it. This was the nicest feature that I would think a 50 dollar app would have-you can‚Äôt create due dates for subtasks. A lot of times I have a project that is due one day, but I have predecessors that must be completed on days prior, there is no way to arrange this in things (once again, a feature that free competing tools offer)-you can‚Äôt check off reoccurring events!!! This drives me nuts as it seems like such a simple feature. I schedule a reoccurring event and make it due a certain day, and although it shows up on that day, you can‚Äôt check it off so I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve done it yet. And if I don‚Äôt complete it, it just goes away the next day soI don‚Äôt remember to do it. These are just a few of many usability complaints I have.

I‚Äôve basically had to resort to other apps for note taking because this has become nearly impossible to write on (unless I write without my palm on the screen and that is definitely not an alternative for me). After reading the previous comments, I have already performed a hard reset of my iPad (an iPad Pro 11‚Äù on iOS 12.3), turned off the palm rejection feature in Notability and turned it back on, and finally uninstalled the app completely then reinstalled.

A while back they limited the free version to just two devices, so I dropped the iPad for my phone and laptop. I use Evernote for everything - work, personal notes, journal, recipes. Pretty much everything I ever write down goes into Evernote. I have no complaints about the desktop version, however the mobile app has been giving me so much trouble over the last year. It‚Äôs been a lot slower and crashes more often. None of my other phone apps do this, and my phone is running very smoothly, so I know it‚Äôs not the device. The other thing that really bothers me is that notes don‚Äôt stay open when the screen turns off or when you switch apps then switch back to Evernote. For example I use Evernote to store all my recipes, and while I‚Äôm cooking I‚Äôll have the note with the recipe open, and then if I switch to my web browser to look up something, or my phone screen turns off, Evernote closes the note and it goes back to the main screen where all your notes are. This is super tedious and frustrating because then instead of looking at my phone to see what‚Äôs next in the recipe, I have to go back and search for the recipe again. It seems like a minor thing, but I think it‚Äôs pretty basic and should be addressed. If my phone was off for a long period of time I wouldn‚Äôt expect the note to stay open, but it‚Äôs always a matter of minutes if not less than a minute.","A while back they limited the free version to just two devices, so I dropped the iPad for my phone and laptop.",4,True,general,free version,31.0,43.0,negative,4

It's mostly good, and I really like being able to tap directly into Gmail's powerful search capabilities. However, the UI changes I‚Äôve seen on my iPad in recent updates has me reluctant to update my iPhone app.First, the handful of buttons on the left side of the iPad version wastes valuable horizontal screen space. You can see this clearly in the first screenshot currently shown on Gmail's App Store page. Below those buttons there's a strip of never-used white space that could otherwise be used for a wider messages list.My second UI complaint is with the messages list itself. Referring back to that same screenshot, I don't know how they got it to show all that information! Maybe it's the jumbo-sized iPad. On my 9.7"" screen, I rarely see the full subject line (it disappears into a ""...""), and the list of senders involved in a thread often disappears into a ""..."" as well. This makes it really frustrating to scan the list of emails for basic information. If those aforementioned side buttons were moved elsewhere, that strip of unused space on the left could be conscripted to make much of that more visible.Bottom line: I find the app really useful, but some UI optimizations could make it a much better place to manage email without resorting to the desktop app!","However, the UI changes I‚Äôve seen on my iPad in recent updates has me reluctant to update my iPhone app.",4,True,usability,update,56.0,62.0,negative,7

Instead of seeing the same page you were on, instead you see the default home page and are forced to navigate back to the one you were reading. If this happened I suspect a lot of people would start using another browser instead.Evernote now operates in much the same way.

Sometimes I even just see a list of notebooks and need to search for the recipe again.It's far easier to screen shot the recipe and reference that instead.

Paper templates and being able to set your 3 most used colors and pen sizes right on the task bar will HOPEFULLY be coming to Notability soon. That is the biggest drawback I think.

I‚Äôm SUPER picky about to-Do apps and I have been on a search for ‚Äúthe one‚Äù for literally years. I think I‚Äôve found it though. They allow you to customize And organize your to-do‚Äôs in a myriad of ways. For instance, my favorite thing so far is the Ability to set ‚ÄúProjects‚Äù and in those projects, you can not only add notes and headings to keep the todos organized but, on the main screen of the app, there‚Äôs a small circle to show your progress on the todo‚Äôs inside. I absolutely love this app and had to let y‚Äôall know you did an amazing job.","However, this app combines functionality with a nice sleek design that‚Äôs not only easy to look at but, easy to use.",5,True,compatibility,design,60.0,66.0,positive,0

Pop3 transfers are agonisingly slow.  Could it be that Gmail is deliberately obtuse in this service?  Other clients have a simple button to refresh pop3.  It's to believe that I have to go through two settings menus and a overfilled list of options to find this elementary convenience.  And there is no control of transfer frequency at all.  This inconvenience does not outweigh the other benefits of a well organized web based client.

If you don‚Äôt buy a subscription you‚Äôre locked out of simple features like landscape. I believe a better way is to allow us to either buy features a la carte or sell the app altogether for one set price. Years of renting this app could become an exuberant expense; having paid into this App many times over in comparison to its worth  or original value.      And even if the argument is ‚Äúyou‚Äôre renting storage space...‚Äù that can be done on a yearly subscription like cloud space with iPhone users. Seems to be no reason for the over charging.

On the one hand, I use it every single day on my iPad. I do a lot of reading/research for my job, so Notability has saved me from being buried under an endless pile of paper. I even pair it up with Scanbot so I can quickly scan materials in meetings and then have all my notes/handouts in a single place. Being able to search my handwriting is a game-changer! So is having access to my documents and notes everywhere, including my laptop, and having all changes and edits synced through iCloud. I‚Äôve always wanted to go paperless with ubiquitous access to everything; Notability is my hub for that. Which brings me to my chief complaint about Notability: it‚Äôs iPhone app is terrible. It‚Äôs nice to see my notes on my phone if I need to skim something quickly on the go, but basic functionality is missing. You can‚Äôt search a document, highlight pages, see all the pages in a document‚Äîif you‚Äôre looking for something, you can only scroll until you find it. That‚Äôs ok if you‚Äôre talking about two pages of notes; but if you are looking at a 50 page journal article trying to find something, it‚Äôs ridiculous. Competitors have this functionality on iPhones, but Notability has never added it. I wish they would! I also wish they would format text-only notes like Google Docs, adjusting text size for a given display without affecting the formatting.","So is having access to my documents and notes everywhere, including my laptop, and having all changes and edits synced through iCloud.",4,True,compatibility,document,27.0,35.0,positive,0

This made it really easy for me to organize my notes and help me maintain order with my notes. Another thing that I really liked was all of the new updates that really helped with making things run more smoothly (i.e. the favorites bar, being able to search for key words within the notes themselves instead of just the title, and the magnifying glass). Some areas of improvement would be being able to adjust the shape of the magnifying box because there are sometimes when I‚Äôm trying to edit a specific place and the magnifying box just doesn‚Äôt fit right. Another thing would be to be able to open more than two notes at once. This would come in handy for those to do notes simultaneously on multiple sections. It would also be cool if when your in portrait mode for the notes you have the option to be able to stack the notes top of one another instead of seeing them side. Then one last area of adjustment would be to be able to have a bookmarked notes bar like how there is a bookmarked pages (within each notes) bar. It would make jumping between two desired note documents a little bit easier.Anyways, that‚Äôs it from me.

It would also be nice if you could change the paper style of individual pages, as well as a feature that easily allows you to draw geometric shapes (adding a figure on top of a graph sticky or any other element get tricky when you click on the wrong one. Sometimes because of that, the graph background ends up on top, and the figure behind it, rendering it useless).There aren‚Äôt really any visible bugs with this version of the app, Would recommend for someone looking for a suitable note taking app, whether it‚Äôs handwritten or type.

Ultimately, I was very happy with Todoist but upon going into the App Store to update it, I stumbled upon things 3. I was intrigued by the positive reviews and design awards and saw this as an opportunity to improve my productivity (I really liked the fact that it could sync with your calendar and that you could add notes to an event). However, these two added benefits do not compensate for the lack of overall usability and functionality. A few of my complaints:-it is insanely challenging to schedule reoccurring events. With Wunderlist and Todoist I could just type ‚Äúsend monthly reports on the second Tuesday of every month‚Äù and it would automatically schedule it, or I could say ‚Äúdo blah blah tomorrow‚Äù and it would schedule it. This was the nicest feature that I would think a 50 dollar app would have-you can‚Äôt create due dates for subtasks. A lot of times I have a project that is due one day, but I have predecessors that must be completed on days prior, there is no way to arrange this in things (once again, a feature that free competing tools offer)-you can‚Äôt check off reoccurring events!!!

I schedule a reoccurring event and make it due a certain day, and although it shows up on that day, you can‚Äôt check it off so I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve done it yet.

I used this for a 504 exception for class, I have permission to record my lectures. On *multiple* occasions this program has capped my notes and recording at 39 minutes and 57 seconds, despite the fact that I continued to record and take notes past that mark. I thought this issue had been fixed with an update but it is not fixed!! I also thought I had figured out the cause, closing my iPad before ending the recording. However, that doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case as I have been very careful to avoid doing that since I discovered it was a possible cause. This program is excellent *when it works*. Sadly, it is not reliable. Take back-up notes or use a different tool until they fix this. :(","I also thought I had figured out the cause, closing my iPad before ending the recording.",1,True,usability,recording,79.0,88.0,negative,7

I can‚Äôt believe how slow and clunky this product is.  Scanning text in is incredibly time consuming due to delays in translating scans to PDFs.  Scan function frequently  recognizes only part of a page, meaning multiple rescans necessary.  Marking up any documents takes 3x as long due to seconds wasted every time you need to translate from one tool to another.  All elements of marking up are glitchy - text box doesn‚Äôt always appear, no erase function (just delete entire edit), stylus writing is clunky, etc.  There is no way I can use this as a substitute for paper copy and hand marking.  This app is the equivalent of taking 15 minutes to solve a problem by text which could have been conveyed in 3 minutes of speech.

You start to type a search word and the search begins.  Before you get the whole word in.  That would be fine, but you can‚Äôt keep typing while the search is running.

It‚Äôs really up to you and how you organize your notes/documents.I do have to warn you if you directly import lecture notes (it was originally a .docx), you‚Äôll have weird cut offs and spacing AND most of the symbols weren‚Äôt showing up. I guess since they have to convert it to a special notability file type, some of it doesn‚Äôt translate properly.

From a useless doodler to a power note-taker,"I really can't say enough about this app. I use it in every class for taking notes, doing homework, and presenting ideas to the other students. Very smooth syncing to iCloud, great importing abilities, and a beautiful interface with just the right amount of customization without being too “busy.” I’m in my fourth year of use and have yet to enjoy any competitor more. Especially since the recent update with the added PDF options (hyperlinks to different pages, searchable text, and highlighting the text itself, not just a handwritten highlighted overlay), this app is nearly perfect.I would consider myself a power user of Notability. My iPad is an academic tool for me, I rarely download games or browse social media on it. Of my time on the device, a solid 75-80% is spent on Notability. It is safe to say I have gone through and tested every option, played with every feature, and have used them all to their fullest extents.That being said, I have a few suggestions for improvements, and will update as I have new ideas:1. Please consider letting a note continue to record audio even if one goes back to the main menu and views something in another note. I end up cutting off my recordings all the time accidentally2.

A few times there were too many differences between devices (I probably left my file open on a different device) and the app asked me which version of the document to use; it worked just like Word’s manuscript comparison function where it highlights the differences between the two files (which is much better than Scrivener—I’ve lost several version of my manuscripts in Scrivener when it couldn’t resolve differences between a file on my laptop and on another device).

More steps are needed to name a document, and the easy tagging features seem to have disappeared. Don’t get me started on finding old documents, a feature that was said to have improved. I’ve taken to using the iCloud more often with these changes. Maybe it’s for the best. Shame that Evernote has now become the junk drawer for those documents I don’t really care as much about.

The scheduling feature has been the real game changer for me. The app tracks due dates (if you have them) but—more importantly— you can also add a schedule date for each task. The interface makes it very easy to add, move, & view tasks in the schedule (while keeping due dates fixed). So you can plan your time (and easily rearrange that plan as needed).

I think Evernote is syncing and I have to wait until it is finished. This is not how it was before. I believe the syncing should be done only after the App is closed and reopened later.

The second thing is about the page loading steps or speed. By moving down the scroll bar the pages are loaded incrementally. But it has too many steps to the bottom page. Scrolling down the bar to the bottom of the screen loads pages a little. I couldn’t find a good way to jump to the bottom page at once. And this happens in Mobile view. The third frustrating thing is the reaction speed is not just slow, it’s really slow. When I type a character, say A, that appears in the screen after about 0.3~0.5s. This issue also has something to do with Mobile view, I think. The fourth is about moving the cursor with a long-touch. This not only related to Word but to all the other Office 365 applications I guess.

And since the app is only deleting part of the note, the lost text can’t be found in the trash. I’ve researched some to find a means of recovering this text, but it sounds like it is impossible.

Another example: a bit harder to describe, but I have to try anyway.

When I am able to work on a document, I can’t do things like italicize the font, or add a footnote. The app becomes mostly unresponsive (though I can still scroll and type).

It would also be nice if you could change the paper style of individual pages, as well as a feature that easily allows you to draw geometric shapes (adding a figure on top of a graph sticky or any other element get tricky when you click on the wrong one.

It was a small annoyance before, but it is happening more and more frequently. Notability likes to lose notes. Many of my peers have problems with this. I lost a weeks worth of notes from notability. Thankfully, I back up to google drive and iCloud. It was present in google drive, but not iCloud. The previous review stands. The problem occurs when people download the iOS app and causes malfunction on the iPad and computer. It is not due to low storage space, as there is plenty of storage space available. Basically, you have to deal with it until it magically stops...or doesn’t. Why keep using notability? Best we have, so we deal with the bugs. Previous review: Please fix the iCloud sync bug. The app decides to sync all my notes in the middle of class, preventing me from taking notes while the sync is happening. It is also duplicating many notes.

It’s either that, or guess based on the date the notes were recorded. If you could at least rename the audio files, the app would be more useful. It would also be nice if you could change the paper style of individual pages, as well as a feature that easily allows you to draw geometric shapes (adding a figure on top of a graph sticky or any other element get tricky when you click on the wrong one.

One thing I’ve tried doing this semester is have the recording function on while at a lecture, but having numerous recordings in a file that grows daily is difficult with the current set up. If you don’t remember the time stamp or recording number for a particular point, you have to guess and listen for a bit to see if it’s right. It’s either that, or guess based on the date the notes were recorded. If you could at least rename the audio files, the app would be more useful. It would also be nice if you could change the paper style of individual pages, as well as a feature that easily allows you to draw geometric shapes (adding a figure on top of a graph sticky or any other element get tricky when you click on the wrong one. Sometimes because of that, the graph background ends up on top, and the figure behind it, rendering it useless).There aren’t really any visible bugs with this version of the app, Would recommend for someone looking for a suitable note taking app, whether it’s handwritten or type.

It will continue even when you try to stop it.  You go crazy too by clicking <cancel>, but it will continue until whatever, then, it suddenly stop its search and goes back to the document. Here, you must start all over again with the same frustration.(2) The solution is to use other text writing tool for writing exactly what you want, then past in the word/text search.(3) The difference between this ap and others is that you can copy something from outside sources and past it into your document.  You will be able to find the text you already copied into it when you use the way I described for text searching.

So I was asked to recover the account!?!? Recover from What? I filled out the online form multiple times and always got denied. Than I went to the help center that is managed by a bot. Trying to get a human on the line was impossible as it asked me eventually every time to log in to my account...What?! Are you kidding me? That’s my problem, you don’t let me back in!!! Than found a phone number searching online, from there it took more than an hour after speaking to several people to finally get the “right” rep.

Although, something that perplexes me is why one of the wealthiest companies in the world feels the need to put sponsored links, or advertisements at the top of my custom mailboxes. It turns me off. I know the app is free, but I don’t see advertisements in other Google apps, so why make the decision to introduce ads on this one?","I use Google services for so many things, and the user experience is great for the purposes I need it for.",4,True,effectiveness,user experience,51.0,66.0,positive,2

The issue of my review has been resolved and I have changed my review to 5 stars. I’ve had the app for a while now. I appreciate having all of my Google based accounts in one place (with pushed notifications of receipt of email), but in the last week or so it has developed a very annoying bug.When I receive an email, I get the red badge in the top right corner of the app’s icon (like all app notifications). HOWEVER, when I check my email and clear out the unread emails, the badge doesn’t go away. Not only is this SEVERELY annoying as I prefer to maintain a clean home screen, it causes me to check my email when unnecessary. This usually means using data and time that is clearly not needed as I don’t have unread emails. I do like the functionality of the app, but I will not continue to use an app that creates unnecessary thought and slows productivity. To me, that is unacceptable and not the point. I humbly ask that Google fix this error or I will be forced to delete the app and go back to using the Apple Mail app.","HOWEVER, when I check my email and clear out the unread emails, the badge doesn’t go away.",5,True,reliability,unread email,50.0,62.0,negative,5

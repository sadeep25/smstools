This is because that when PDFs are imported, many of them are oriented in the wrong direction for reading. However, users can‚Äôt alter them inside the notability app, which means that users have to use another app to do so. This is very inefficient, and the fact that not many note taking apps can do this means that notability will get a head start advantage.2.

Another thing that I really liked was all of the new updates that really helped with making things run more smoothly (i.e. the favorites bar, being able to search for key words within the notes themselves instead of just the title, and the magnifying glass). Some areas of improvement would be being able to adjust the shape of the magnifying box because there are sometimes when I‚Äôm trying to edit a specific place and the magnifying box just doesn‚Äôt fit right. Another thing would be to be able to open more than two notes at once. This would come in handy for those to do notes simultaneously on multiple sections. It would also be cool if when your in portrait mode for the notes you have the option to be able to stack the notes top of one another instead of seeing them side. Then one last area of adjustment would be to be able to have a bookmarked notes bar like how there is a bookmarked pages (within each notes) bar.

A note goes blank with any edit, and can only be retrieved by closing and reopening the app, which takes forever when your client is standing there. Inserting checkboxes (or anything else) is unbelievably clunky and buggy. The sketch function is plagued with lags and disfunction.

I post a lot of articles from webpages or the Flipboard app, and in the previous version of Evernote, these appeared immediately to my list of notes.  I just sent a short article to Evernote from Flipboard that took 22 minutes to load.  Evernote just showed it in the Notes list with a spinning wheel of death.  Man, I hate it when software engineers turn something that worked well and that I enjoyed using into something that just aggravates and annoys me.  What a pity this has happened to Evernote.  Afternote:  in the tag list, the A-Z index has been removed, so to skip from Apple to Zebra tags requires scrolling through the entire tag list.

On the iPhone, the app crashes every time I lock my phone. Even if I lock it for 2 seconds just to test this theory, it will crash without fail. Fortunately, it ALWAYS saves the note before closing the app (props to you, devs).

However, it's not quite like it because it lacks a lot of features that enhance user experience. Also, it can be a bit frustrating to get it to act right. Well, it's a phone/tablet version; so, what do you expect? But it'd be great to throw in very close to 100% of the features of the Windows version. That's why I decided to punch off two stars. Do something about it, app owners, and I'd throw in both stars.","However, it's not quite like it because it lacks a lot of features that enhance user experience.",3,True,usability,user experience,81.0,96.0,positive,7

First problem - When I go back and add information to my notes, anything that I have previously highlighted is no longer highlighted because the highlighter stays in place in the note but the notes move.  This causes me to have to go back and re-highlight everything or not add to the note. Second problem - MANY times, when I try to crop or adjust photos I add, the program kicks me back to the top of the page several times. I end up having to close the program and go back into it. Sometimes this helps, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt.Third problem - The photos/screen shots that are added into the notes do not move with the area they are placed in the notes. If I add notes, I have to go back and move every single screenshot / photo.Fourth problem - Customer Service is horrible. I have tried to contact the company. It took them over 3 months to respond to one concern with no resolution to my concern but instead they told me they have exciting audio recording improvements on the way. Other concerns have gone with no response whatsoever.Is there a way to get a refund on this program? I am guessing if I asked, I wouldn‚Äôt get a response anyways.","Second problem - MANY times, when I try to crop or adjust photos I add, the program kicks me back to the top of the page several times.",1,True,compatibility,photo,59.0,64.0,negative,0

However, this was a pretty critical function when I needed it, and this app is the industry leader with so many reviews that a one star review is the best way that I can think of to bring attention to the issue.I was attempting to attach an important, time sensitive document to an email in Gmail. I had it saved in both the iCloud file directory and Drive. I could not access the iCloud file directory from Gmail, and the app would only include the file from Drive as a link (at least, that was my understanding from the pop-up messages I received). It was vital that the file be sent as an attachment, so I ended up adding my Gmail account to Mail and using that.I had only been using Gmail since Inbox was discontinued, and I haven‚Äôt found it to be exceptionally better than Mail. With this issue, I may not return to Gmail.","I was attempting to attach an important, time sensitive document to an email in Gmail.",1,True,reliability,document,57.0,65.0,positive,5

But I have a question,"This app does not feel like a boring list of obligations.  It feels like an actual game!  This is mainly due to the amount of work that went into the actual design of the game.  By making the trees appealing, you feel like you want to get as many of them as possible and after getting the trees you want, you feel a sense of care for your garden tycoon.  It‚Äôs worth every penny because you also know that your money is in good hands that are willing to help the world by planting real trees.  However, I have a question:  How do you change the color of the oak tree?

It has some nice features like I can see my today list on my apple watch. It does what it says but its not really more than a simple list todo app. I really wish there was a calendar view. Like in ‚ÄòUpcoming‚Äô, if you could tap the calendar icon and actually see a calendar. There‚Äôs no way to see details more than a week in advance. So if you like to plan out your month, this isn‚Äôt the app for you. Also, when I am scheduling a repeating task on a specific day for the next week, the app doesn‚Äôt recognize the day. It always wants to repeat on Wednesday and I have to change it. Its minor, yes, but still annoying. Same thing with repeating a monthly task. It doesn‚Äôt recognize the date and I have to manually put it in. Honestly, I regret buying it. There are cheaper and better options on the app store.",It has some nice features like I can see my today list on my apple watch.,3,True,general,list,51.0,55.0,positive,4

I especially like I can click on a link in any email and it will open in the chrome app. However my need for email is photo centric and the extremely limited access to photos is terribly. I am unable to send a short video at all. In addition I have thousands of photos on my phone so they are classified in different folders in my phone. The only pictures I can access are the ones by date. So if I was looking for something that was taken 9 months ago I would have to scroll back though all the photos since then. That‚Äôs just plain stupid. It‚Äôs even worse when I have to tell a client this app won‚Äôt let me access the photo so I‚Äôll change emails and send to you. Not worth the hassle.,However my need for email is photo centric and the extremely limited access to photos is terribly.,2,True,usability,photo,30.0,35.0,positive,7

Things 3 doesn‚Äôt have all the bells and whistles that 2Do has, but it has nearly all the ones I used. Personally, the ability to color-code projects/lists was something I really enjoyed in 2Do and wish it was present in Things 3. I hope this is added soon. Pictures is also something I look forward to adding, as another way to visualize my tasks. Finally, I wish there was more integration into alternative calendar apps, such as Fantastical. Being able to link to and from my task-manager and my calendar is awesome, but it only links to native calendar. Hopefully this is expanded in the future. Overall, Things 3 has been an absolute joy to use, and I‚Äôve almost completely migrated from 2Do because of the awesome interface.","Overall, Things 3 has been an absolute joy to use, and I‚Äôve almost completely migrated from 2Do because of the awesome interface.",4,True,general,interface,120.0,129.0,negative,4

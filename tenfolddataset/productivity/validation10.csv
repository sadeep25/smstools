Now that it’s here, it creates a constant tug of war between what Word wants to do and the way the iPad cursor works in other apps (e.g. Notes, any other Apple app). The cursor does now change shape - that’s new - but it doesn’t cooperate with actual editing.Try entering a non-dictionary word and then placing the cursor between any two letters of that word - Word decides to select the entire word instead, every time. Try opening one of the built-in templates - such as “Make a List” - and then positioning the cursor anywhere within the text for item 1 or 2 on the list - Word selects all the text for both items 1 and 2 instead of positioning the cursor. You end up having to resort to touch, or using cursor keys.It doesn’t look as if anyone tested basic editing functionality, and it’s barely better than before pointer “support” was added.

It became a procrastination tool. I could spend an hour entering dates, setting up filters, and customizing views only to realize at the end of that time that I hadn’t actually gotten anything done. In contrast, Things 3 is wonderfully simple and clarifying. It’s as powerful as my previous app, but it strips out all the distractions and the fussiness, leaving pure, easy-to-access essentials: tagging, scheduling & project organizing. The scheduling feature has been the real game changer for me. The app tracks due dates (if you have them) but—more importantly— you can also add a schedule date for each task. The interface makes it very easy to add, move, & view tasks in the schedule (while keeping due dates fixed). So you can plan your time (and easily rearrange that plan as needed). If you’re a GTD person, you can still use that methodology with Things 3 projects & tags.

I am a paying customer, but I have been looking for an exit strategy for a while. Because it was difficult to export content from Evernote in a simple, satisfactory way, it had become my elephant graveyard of digital content.This new version will accelerate leaving Evernote behind for good. First impressions were not good. When a new note is selected, the screen flashes, usually twice, like graphics terminals from long ago. This is especially obvious in dark mode. Rendering is slow, with embedded images appearing after text even on a current-model iPad Pro. Web clipping is inferior to almost every other app, and done off-device. You can’t export without Internet, which is really stupid.I think there’s a good chance that this will be a watershed moment for Evernote the company, and not in a good way.",This is especially obvious in dark mode.,1,True,reliability,dark mode,31.0,40.0,positive,5

It’s unique recording feature is perfect for lecture notes, and so I decided to give it a full month test, switching from another very well known note taking app and using Notability exclusively. The result, now that the month’s experiment has concluded, is that I’m switching back to the other app. Leaving aside all the countless comparisons and contrasts between these two apps, the deal breaker for me was that Notability’s syncing between iPhone, iPad, and Mac is awful. Any imported big file would only sync to one device, never appearing on all three. PDF imports were the worst—I would check literally DAYS later for a given pdf file to appear on ALL of my devices, only to have it stuck on the one device I originally imported it from. The only way to finally get some files to sync was to delete the Notability app and reinstall it, and even then it was only successful some of the time. As you might imagine, that workaround was beyond disappointing—it was incredibly inconvenient and completely untenable.Don’t get me wrong: Notability is still a very worthwhile purchase. There’s a lot to like about the features and its ease of use, and I’ll definitely be keeping it as my backup. And I’ll still use it whenever I need to combine note taking with recordings. But until the developers fix syncing, there’s no way that I could ever rely on this as my go-to app for notes or creative projects.","Any imported big file would only sync to one device, never appearing on all three.",5,True,general,sync,34.0,38.0,positive,4

I rely on it to organize notes and recipes, and also to track bookmarked articles that I want to reference later. The most recent iOS update has made the app completely unusable. Every action is painfully slow. It crashes often. And then when I finally get a note open (like a recipe, for example), if I switch between Evernote and another app, then Evernote completely restarts and I lose my place and have to search for the note again. This happens even if I switch apps for less then a minute. On top of that, I use Evernote primarily to bookmark webpages, not to clip them. When I open up a note, it’s unclear how to force the app to take me to the original webpage. Sometimes if I tap the note to edit it, Evernote launches its embedded browser (which is ridiculously slow). But other times when I tap the note, it goes into editing mode and there aren’t any options to navigate to the original webpage. I use Evernote to reference recipes several times a week, and I had to stop using my phone for that task. Instead, I search for the recipe using Google on my laptop because it’s faster. Obviously that totally defeats the purpose of having an app on my phone. I’ve never written an App Store review before, but I’m so disappointed in this update that I felt compelled to post something.

Occasionally while taking notes on a PDF and recording audio during crucial lectures, the app will freeze and crash. Upon reopening the app, it will state that it is recovering the audio file... but never actually recovers it. The audio is lost. The ability to match up audio with handwritten notes is the best feature of the app, but if it can’t do this reliably, I will be forced to utilize other options.

It should cache your last document you worked on locally so that you don’t have to reload it when you return. This is important for iOS because of how you have to app switch. The funny thing is that before loading the app, I was able to access the more full featured web version of Word in Safari on iOS and it worked for the most part.

So my notes have to hang long names which is super annoying. And I just want to be able to group my notes like I want and create as many subfolders as my heart desires. I just don’t understand why they don’t have this functionality. Dont think it’d be too hard to execute. Shame really because it takes away from what is otherwise a perfect app!",You can only create subjects and dividers which is just horrible.,3,True,effectiveness,,,,negative,2

I like the layout and aesthetics. I was surprised at how far I had to dig for the simple task of adding or editing a (sub-)folder. Additionally, a plus side to the app is the ability to add multiple (non-)Google inboxes and have one app for all email. Love this feature. I did become quite annoyed when the app started incorrectly reporting the number of unread or outstanding emails with the badge icon. I had to verify on my laptop that I had either no emails in my inbox or all emails were read. I did this on my Gmail emails, Outlook email, and iCloud email. I keep my inboxes clean and I expect my apps to correctly report this too. I don't have time to be digging for a hidden unread email.",I like the layout and aesthetics.,3,True,usability,layout,12.0,18.0,positive,7

And it *was* a really awesome app. ...and then, they added paid subscriptions; and those of us who opted not to pay for features we don’t value were effectively abandoned. Half my notes won’t load anymore, and the only “customer service” option you have is the user forum.  Literally every single instruction on their help pages tell you to create a support ticket; but the chat feature is conveniently never available, and the email feature is only available to paid accounts.  Extremely disappointed in the “screw you” attitude that Evernote seems to have adopted.",I used it for everything from shopping lists to subscription information to the chores my kids are supposed to do.,1,True,effectiveness,,,,positive,2

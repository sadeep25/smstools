I contacted support with my issue, pictures and all, and I got no response. It‚Äôs been two months, and the issue persists. PLEASE fix this.

Now icloud syncing takes over 30 minutes to load documents. it‚Äôs not my wifi, trust me. Every app / icloud itself works perfectly fine otherwise on its own. My favorite (and first) incident of this happening was when I started a timed test (open note).

It's mostly good, and I really like being able to tap directly into Gmail's powerful search capabilities. However, the UI changes I‚Äôve seen on my iPad in recent updates has me reluctant to update my iPhone app.First, the handful of buttons on the left side of the iPad version wastes valuable horizontal screen space. You can see this clearly in the first screenshot currently shown on Gmail's App Store page. Below those buttons there's a strip of never-used white space that could otherwise be used for a wider messages list.My second UI complaint is with the messages list itself. Referring back to that same screenshot, I don't know how they got it to show all that information! Maybe it's the jumbo-sized iPad. On my 9.7"" screen, I rarely see the full subject line (it disappears into a ""...""), and the list of senders involved in a thread often disappears into a ""..."" as well. This makes it really frustrating to scan the list of emails for basic information. If those aforementioned side buttons were moved elsewhere, that strip of unused space on the left could be conscripted to make much of that more visible.Bottom line: I find the app really useful, but some UI optimizations could make it a much better place to manage email without resorting to the desktop app!",You can see this clearly in the first screenshot currently shown on Gmail's App Store page.,4,True,usability,page,87.0,91.0,positive,7

Second, if I am creating a document in Word, but switch off to a different app, coming back to Word means I wait while my document downloads from the cloud again.  Every. Single. Time.  When I tried to get around this by saving the doc to the iPad, I found a bug.  I created a doc, saved it to the iPad.  Then I created another doc, saved it to the iPad also.  While working with the second doc, if I switched to another app and then come back to Word, it reloads the first document!

I was intrigued by the positive reviews and design awards and saw this as an opportunity to improve my productivity (I really liked the fact that it could sync with your calendar and that you could add notes to an event). However, these two added benefits do not compensate for the lack of overall usability and functionality. A few of my complaints:-it is insanely challenging to schedule reoccurring events. With Wunderlist and Todoist I could just type ‚Äúsend monthly reports on the second Tuesday of every month‚Äù and it would automatically schedule it, or I could say ‚Äúdo blah blah tomorrow‚Äù and it would schedule it. This was the nicest feature that I would think a 50 dollar app would have-you can‚Äôt create due dates for subtasks. A lot of times I have a project that is due one day, but I have predecessors that must be completed on days prior, there is no way to arrange this in things (once again, a feature that free competing tools offer)-you can‚Äôt check off reoccurring events!!! This drives me nuts as it seems like such a simple feature. I schedule a reoccurring event and make it due a certain day, and although it shows up on that day, you can‚Äôt check it off so I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve done it yet.

OneNote has good editing tools within a note, but seems to be lacking when comes to FINDING your notes. I like Evernote‚Äôs search ability - select one ore more tags or a notebook - and then search within that context.  I like that you can see Evernote‚Äôs list of tags at a glance on the left - and then quickly see a list of those notes that have that tag.  And when you put in a search string, Evernote instantly shows you a list of notes that match, along with the first few lines of the note - even if what you‚Äôre searching for is within an embedded image (or PDF file since I have Premium).  This ability to quickly find what you‚Äôre looking for within a thousand notes is critical for me.  I don‚Äôt think ON is a replacement for Evernote for me - because of this alone.

Unfortunately, with the last update half of my notes are in limbo re-downloading from iCloud. I‚Äôve done the suggested ways to recover my notes up to #10. I‚Äôm terrified of loosing all the work I have done since this issue started so I haven‚Äôt gone beyond turning iCloud off and on again in the app. I‚Äôm in my last semester of nursing school and I need my notes so I don‚Äôt end up accidentally killing someone when we are allowed back in the hospitals. Yes, I have contacted support (weeks ago). No, no one has gotten back to me about this issue. A similar iCloud thing happened about a year ago. I guess I just have to wait for them to push out another update? Additionally, the app just freezes now. Can‚Äôt scroll, can‚Äôt type, cant write. I have to close it out and open it again crossing my fingers that it kept recording while it was unresponsive. I really need this app to release my notes from limbo.

But one thing that bugs me is that; After a round an ad plays, right? Sometimes I get an 30 second long unskippable ad. And the game goes on without me and the server gets full. Then it kicks me out and says ‚ÄúThis server is full‚Äù I know you probably cannot stop this from happening. But I have no one else to talk to so I only have you guys.Update: Oh! And I forgot, sometimes people make servers and people join, only to get kicked or blocked by the host. I don‚Äôt understand why people do this. What do they get out of it you ask? Nothing. Can you please make a limit of how many people you can kick? Or perhaps rules I am sincerely sorry if this problem has been fixed. But I haven‚Äôt seen it with my own eyes happen to ME, but I‚Äôve seen it happen to others.Update: I‚Äôve now discovered that the ‚ÄúAutomatic role‚Äù system is very bad for me. I‚Äôve gotten Crewmate almost all of the time. Now it‚Äôs rare if I even get imposter ONCE. I try every single day. But now it‚Äôs a very boring app for me since all I get is Crewmate and always get killed first, then have to deal with dumb people who see the body but just stand by it without reporting, then another person comes in and thinks it that person since they‚Äôre standing near the body.","And I forgot, sometimes people make servers and people join, only to get kicked or blocked by the host.",5,True,safety,negative,8

This is fun, too, but you have to be prepared for some disappointment. Currently, there are bugs that prevent games from being finished, and these bugs can happen after you‚Äôve played for 30 minutes or more. For example, if somebody owes money, and they try to make another deal to raise more money, this seems to stop the game. It seems to lose track of whose turn it is (and who is still owed money). Sometimes, if someone refuses all your deals for that turn, it ends your turn for some reason, but the End Turn button is still shown. Pressing End Turn at this point stops the game. If you are low on battery life and get a battery warning, it can disconnect you from the game. Also, players sometimes stop playing, and there‚Äôs no warning or way to resign without stopping the game for everyone. In spite of these flaws, it‚Äôs a fun game, but there‚Äôs room for improvement. Personally, I‚Äôm waiting for these issues to get addressed before investing more money in a Season Pass.","Sometimes, if someone refuses all your deals for that turn, it ends your turn for some reason, but the End Turn button is still shown.",3,True,reliability,negative,7

After playing almost 20 single player matches I found some major flaws. The most annoying being the roll of the dice is not random. I understand that anything can happen in a dice roll but it seems the dice rolls are scripted. To prove this I played a single player match against one ai player on easy. I controlled all property and railroads from the go square to free parking, yes that includes the orange properties!  The opposing side only had boardwalk and park place. We both had hotels on all monopolies owned. For a numbered point of reference that‚Äôs 13 out of 20 to one side while the ai had 2 out of 20 on the opposing side. I recorded 12 cycles and I landed 8 out of 12 cycles on either one of his two squares while the ai landed only 9 times on my 13 squares out of the 12 cycles. Almost every cycle I landed on his two properties and yet many times the ai only landed on a chance, just visiting, income tax, or community passing through unscathed on my side of the board. When the ai did land it was a surprise. I‚Äôve played enough games to realize there is some scripting going on. Very disappointed!","I controlled all property and railroads from the go square to free parking, yes that includes the orange properties!",3,True,general,positive,5

It‚Äôs just so fun and addicting. I just got it about three weeks ago and I haven‚Äôt stopped playing since. Although it‚Äôs a very well made very fun to play game, there‚Äôs some things that I think would be cool to add either to among us or among us 2. 1. There should be a way to kick people faster if you‚Äôre the host during a game. Some people like to call emergency meetings and waste time, so being able to kick them out would make it go by way faster. 2. I think it would be awesome to add a send a friend request button. Some people have really good friendships on here and a lot of the time one of them might disconnect or have to go and never see each other again! ;( If we had a add friend button, we could always play with them. Plus, when you try to give your personal number or social media‚Äôs out to someone, the whole server can see it unless you ban them all. 3. I think I saw this on another review, but maybe add a limit to camera time? It‚Äôs kinda hard to kill when people are guarding the cameras. 4. Hackers and exploiters should be automatically banned from playing. Maybe you could install a thing that detects their programming and stuff? They ruin the game a lot. Other than that, this game is amazing! Definitely game of the year. It‚Äôs made 2020 so much better. 5 stars for sure",It‚Äôs just so fun and addicting.,5,True,general,positive,5

After playing very frequently, I‚Äôve been noticing some issues. 1. Dice rolls do not seem random. Quite frequently the computer rolls the perfect number to squeak by your hotels. It happens way too often. 2 when playing multiple computer opponents, if the first computer player on the list of players on the right side of the screen goes bankrupt, you can no longer purpose a deal with the other remaining opponent. It defaults to try to make a trade with the bankrupted player with no option to change it to the other player, so the only way to trade is to wait for the computer to strike a trade with you and then counter the trade. 3 when you get a card that says each player pays $10 for a birthday or whatever, the money never comes out of the players account. Maybe that‚Äôs because of the free parking rule. Not sure. 4 if you use up all of the houses so that there aren‚Äôt any more in reserve, and then sell a hotel, more houses Automatically appear.

It‚Äôs all based if the game allows the pieces to fall, the boosters to point in the direction needed to win. A blind monkey can play this game because it‚Äôs all luck, like a slot machine.

When I got back on Minecraft, I got to my settings, but the add-on wasn't in the Resource Packs setting thingymajober. I got confused. I went to Storage, and I saw the Better Drops add-on. Except that it won't let me activate it. That's weird. Please tell me how to activate behavior packs. Also, I have a suggestion. Minecraft just got boring because there were no other items that are really decorative, like when you want to build a house, you needed a toilet. But there is no toilet in Minecraft. Mods like Decocraft mod and Bibliocraft mod have many other items that are decorative for a house, but sadly there are no mods for Minecraft PE. What I mean by this is that mods don't work on Minecraft PE. There are only Addons, but really Addons just REPLACE other items. Please add more items like toilets or TVs and more in Minecraft!

As far as games go this is the most addicting mobile game I‚Äôve personally played. I‚Äôve enjoyed it  since this game came to iOS and have even purchased some in-game cosmetic gear. I just wanna say I appreciate the devs don‚Äôt give any pay to win options in the game. Some of the tasks are annoying and the maps need balancing I think. Other than that I think the gameplay is the strongest aspect of this game as it preys on our natural suspicions of others and that‚Äôs an amazing concept for strangers and friends to play. The biggest problem I‚Äôve had though, and the reason for the 3 star rating is due to the fact that I can hardly even get matches when I want to. I get error messages often saying I was dropped from the server or that the matchmaker is full. As someone who has put money into this game I find this unacceptable. I understand the rare server issue here and there but when it takes over 20 minutes to search for game I feel like I‚Äôm literally wasting time. This game was the number one ranked action game at one point and there are ads at the end of every match. Surely the devs need to work out a better deal with their current sponsors.

There are a few suggestions that I would like to make though. The first suggestion is decreasing the prices for the avatars. I just think they‚Äôre a little bit expensive. Don‚Äôt get me wrong they‚Äôre great characters, but bumping down the price a little wouldn‚Äôt hurt. The second suggestion is offering more discounts on things like coins and prize boxes in the game. Maybe you could even call it Discount Day or Discount Week. The last suggestion is putting more missions in the game. Like for example, having the game players find LIMITED EDITION Gold boxes along the trail, that are filled with SUPER RARE things like unlocking special characters or getting a BIG amount of gems or coins. Other than these few suggestions, this game is amazingly fun! I like how it travels around the world to a new location every other month, and has characters that you buy from that specific location to go along with the theme! This game is SUPER fun when you need a blast of adventure and thrill! My rating for this game would be the FULL 5 stars! You Subway Surfer Developers have earned it!

The graphics, gameplay, and everything overall is amazing! I was also thinking of some things that could be added. This is something I heard on the internet and isn‚Äôt original, but I wanted to spread it around because it sounds interesting. What if there was a role called ‚ÄúJester‚Äù where their goal is to get ejected, making them win? Sounds like it could be a hit or miss, but I think that‚Äôd be cool. Also a role of ‚ÄúDetective‚Äù sounds interesting. Like, you can give that person the option to take screenshots, so they can have solid alibis/evidence of the imposter, but only they have it, so that the crew mates don‚Äôt have too much of an advantage. They can send the screenshots to the chat, helping out their case (maybe also a limited amount of screenshots so their not overpowered?). Also the idea of adding friends would be cool! It‚Äôs sad you can‚Äôt add anyone, and the strangers you could enjoy playing with you‚Äôll only play with once. It would also be nice to adopt mini crew mates whenever their parent dies, I just think that would be very wholesome. More colors would also be cool, I mean, this is only optional since the colors that are already there are great, but I think it‚Äôs something to keep in mind. But overall, fantastic game!

I try to spread positivity in the chat reassuring people that it‚Äôs just a game no need to get mad. But... when I do I just get called racial slurs, homophobic slurs, and horrible names in general. When joining a game on WiFi it will keep saying unable to connect. And it is too hard to kick people from games especially when everyone has to vote for them to leave. Teaming is a HUGE issue in the game with entire groups of friends outing the imposters as soon as the game starts. The emergency button is used too often... or often use it to SAY HI!!! I find it frustrating when trying to play the game. PLEASE ADD A VOICE CHAT OPTION!!!

You earn one star from winning each candy crush game no matter how difficult the game is. Win in one round, earn one star. Win after 20 rounds, earn one star. The idea of course is to get the player to purchase items to play longer. I get it. Most games I have seen do the same thing, but they don‚Äôt ramp up the difficulty so quickly.","Most games I have seen do the same thing, but they don‚Äôt ramp up the difficulty so quickly.",3,True,general,negative,5

That part was a waste of coding and time for one little thing that they don‚Äôt need, and it was annoying. I just started playing, and I already like it, but I also see that it will be a little stubborn and slow at certain times. And in Austin‚Äôs room, when your done with it and everything looks new, there‚Äôs a dusty old desk that doesn‚Äôt go with the room, and I felt  like I should replace it, but I can‚Äôt. There were a few more parts that didn‚Äôt need to be there, but they put them there. Like when Austin‚Äôs dad stomps on the floor and breaks it, he they didn‚Äôt have to do that. Austin would have repaired it anyway. I am also confused about when Austin got to the house and went into his room and instead of a bed, there was a couch. Where did he sleep? Also, if nobody had lived in the house for years, why where the clothes on the statues not dusty? If you make another game from another game then shouldn‚Äôt you mention it?

However, it is far too common for a player to get disconnected or for the game to freeze, ultimately ruining the entire game and leading me to have wasted 2 hours of my time. Also, it is hard to differentiate when a player is simply not paying attention, forgets to roll, or forgets to end their turn so it would be EXTREMELY USEFUL to have a ******chat function****** or at least a button the players could use to notify other players when the game has come to a standstill. I really hope that the monopoly app creators will take these suggestions into account as I have recommended the app to many people and know they have experienced the same frustration as me. Also, it would be awesome if their was a way to pause the game (which I know may actually difficult due to connection issues). Additionally, the game disconnects when someone gets a phone call or even if low battery signal pops up on a players phone. Sometimes the bots will pick up and play for the disconnected user but other times the game is screwed. Regardless, I love how the game is customizable and has great layouts. Love this game, will definitely keep playing, but would profoundly appreciate some improvements given that the Monopoly brand has historically been held with such high regard.","Additionally, the game disconnects when someone gets a phone call or even if low battery signal pops up on a players phone.",2,True,effectiveness,negative,2

I don‚Äôt mind spending the money here and there, but it‚Äôs so expensive, it doesn‚Äôt even make it worth it. You get 1000 coins for .99 and it takes 900 coins to get 5 extra turns.

It‚Äôs beginning to add up with how many coins I‚Äôve been buying just to beat rounds. On top of that I believe that there are also sometimes when the board isn‚Äôt applying the power ups correctly.

The game is fun and requires lots of skill or just fast fingers. My only problems are the prices of some of the items. For the characters I think they can get a little bit pricey. When you get a mystery box it can give you items that help you unlock characters. I honestly think that it might take a month or almost a year to reach the amount because I‚Äôm not joking, they are really pricey. Unless you playing it nonstop without taking your eyes off the screen then it might take a few weeks. But that‚Äôs still a while. Also the hover boards. They can also get a little pricey. And why buy something that you can only use in certain times. It makes it worse that they can get really expensive. Honestly I think their pretty cool but please lower the prices. The last thing you might need to fix is the add lag. Sometimes it will start freezing up and you have to restart the app and that‚Äôs a little annoying in my opinion. I also think that you should only have to face adds if your getting something for free. Other than those issues I truly love the game!

This is obviously built on that annoying subscription model for premium services. And it‚Äôs not free in the first place. No, I don‚Äôt want to pay extra for a new board or player piece...it‚Äôs just software. Give me a break.Second, there are some pretty bad playability issues. One is initiating trades; the user interface makes it impossible to pick multiple things on the left half of the screen because the player boxes cover the properties. Another is that tapping anywhere near the bottom right when trying to select one of your own properties causes the game to think you tapped the ‚Äúend turn‚Äù button, screwing up your turn. Another horrible gameplay thing is the fact that AI players constantly choose ‚Äúauction‚Äù instead of buying properties outright, which is not at all like how people in real life play the game. Not only that, but the AI player that initiated the auction will bid all the way up to the original cost of the property...why on earth would anyone ever do that? Sloppy gameplay for sure.The older Monopoly game on the App Store, which I purchased long ago, was quite a bit better. This is obviously aimed at milking people for buying new playing boards and player pieces. Pretty gross cash grab.

The problem is you have to get stars from playing one game only. And even on a hard level you still get 1 star. It‚Äôs annoying how fast your stars run out.

What I‚Äôm saying is give more chances to get stars. Like as a prize. Instead of just money, give us a little money and a star! Or have different games besides just the one game to match the colors.     Another thing is that it takes so long to complete one floor or one area of the house because of how limited of the stars you have.

For example, every task around the house goes from costing one star to two. The rewards aren‚Äôt sufficient to the amount of boosts being spent on harder levels.

The game is trying to get you to use all your stars so you have to play more, which is typical, but with the levels so hard, it‚Äôs really just a tactic to get people to spend more money.

Instead of throwing in so many different aspects into the puzzle games so soon, they should have waited and made it harder much later.

I like Homescapes much better than gradenscapes just because the colors and the graphics are better int my opinion. At least the game is a little better.     The problem is you have to get stars from playing one game only. And even on a hard level you still get 1 star. It‚Äôs annoying how fast your stars run out. What‚Äôs even more annoying, it‚Äôs that sometimes you have to give one of your stars just to open a box, that you‚Äôve already given a star for box to get to the house! What I‚Äôm saying is give more chances to get stars. Like as a prize. Instead of just money, give us a little money and a star! Or have different games besides just the one game to match the colors.     Another thing is that it takes so long to complete one floor or one area of the house because of how limited of the stars you have. So I suppose you should just focus on the star problem because it will fix this one of taking so long! üòÜ     Please take this into consideration. The game would be much more entertaining and exciting if I didn‚Äôt give up so much on the game.

However, I bought this app so that I could play with my long distant friends, but we could never finish ANY game. The game has way too many bugs. It crashes and stop the game every time someone disconnect, which affects you and everyone else playing the same match. Getting disconnected is way too common, it happens when you get notification, when you click off the game for a split second, when you get a call, when you get a low battery warning, or poor wifi connection. The game can stop and crash at any point in the game. I wasted 2 hours playing a round just so it could crash mostly every single time. Out of the 35 games I‚Äôve played, I only got through 7 of them. Mind you, I had to pay for this app. It‚Äôs ridiculous. DONT BUY THIS APP unless they start making changes and improvements to it. Also they do not have any type of communication system so you can‚Äôt talk to your opponents. That should be included in the game to communicate with your opponents, negotiate for trades, or just to simply remind your opponents to end the game. There are many more flaws that takes away the authentic feeling of playing the boardgame Monopoly. Once again, don‚Äôt waste your money and time on this app until they start making further improvements and changes to it.","Out of the 35 games I‚Äôve played, I only got through 7 of them.",2,True,enjoyability,positive,4

After playing almost 20 single player matches I found some major flaws. The most annoying being the roll of the dice is not random. I understand that anything can happen in a dice roll but it seems the dice rolls are scripted. To prove this I played a single player match against one ai player on easy. I controlled all property and railroads from the go square to free parking, yes that includes the orange properties!  The opposing side only had boardwalk and park place. We both had hotels on all monopolies owned. For a numbered point of reference that‚Äôs 13 out of 20 to one side while the ai had 2 out of 20 on the opposing side. I recorded 12 cycles and I landed 8 out of 12 cycles on either one of his two squares while the ai landed only 9 times on my 13 squares out of the 12 cycles. Almost every cycle I landed on his two properties and yet many times the ai only landed on a chance, just visiting, income tax, or community passing through unscathed on my side of the board. When the ai did land it was a surprise. I‚Äôve played enough games to realize there is some scripting going on.

When I got back on Minecraft, I got to my settings, but the add-on wasn't in the Resource Packs setting thingymajober. I got confused. I went to Storage, and I saw the Better Drops add-on. Except that it won't let me activate it. That's weird. Please tell me how to activate behavior packs. Also, I have a suggestion. Minecraft just got boring because there were no other items that are really decorative, like when you want to build a house, you needed a toilet. But there is no toilet in Minecraft. Mods like Decocraft mod and Bibliocraft mod have many other items that are decorative for a house, but sadly there are no mods for Minecraft PE. What I mean by this is that mods don't work on Minecraft PE. There are only Addons, but really Addons just REPLACE other items. Please add more items like toilets or TVs and more in Minecraft!

The game is fun and requires lots of skill or just fast fingers. My only problems are the prices of some of the items. For the characters I think they can get a little bit pricey. When you get a mystery box it can give you items that help you unlock characters. I honestly think that it might take a month or almost a year to reach the amount because I‚Äôm not joking, they are really pricey. Unless you playing it nonstop without taking your eyes off the screen then it might take a few weeks. But that‚Äôs still a while. Also the hover boards. They can also get a little pricey. And why buy something that you can only use in certain times. It makes it worse that they can get really expensive. Honestly I think their pretty cool but please lower the prices. The last thing you might need to fix is the add lag. Sometimes it will start freezing up and you have to restart the app and that‚Äôs a little annoying in my opinion. I also think that you should only have to face adds if your getting something for free. Other than those issues I truly love the game!

The puzzles and all were really fun. But I just don‚Äôt like the fact that every little thing you do cost multiple stars and so you have to complete multiple levels to do the simplest things that honestly shouldn‚Äôt cost a star at all. Really thought the game would be more focused on designing the house. Not the garden or paying attention to what‚Äôs going on in town. Additionally, I understand the game is supposed to be challenging. But who honestly has time to spend weeks trying beat a single level to continue on with the game. Some levels are literally so difficult that the user ends up frustrated and just closing the game out for the day. Sure I‚Äôve spent a fair amount on money trying to beat those select levels. And I see some user reviews that talk about spending a huge amount of money. But who honestly has time to devote that much energy into a game as well as waste money trying to get through a level just to get stuck and have to spend more money again later on a higher level.

When this happens, it keeps happening, and you can‚Äôt get onto your Minecraft, not even onto your home screen, so you can try to find out what is wrong.

What I‚Äôm saying is give more chances to get stars. Like as a prize. Instead of just money, give us a little money and a star! Or have different games besides just the one game to match the colors.

Second of all, there has been numerous amount of glitches in the past few days. To start off, it will randomly kick you out of a game while you‚Äôre  in the middle of one. This really makes me mad and frustrated because of how many times it‚Äôs happened. Next, there is a hacker. You will join a game and the screen will be all black and you can free run wherever. Then when you check the chat it has a link telling you random stuff and to vote for trump. This can be really scary for young ones and we should also not bring any thing political into a game that kids are playing for fun. Also, in the text it says it will hack with your WiFi. Which is true, not for me, but people I know. It logs them out of their WiFi and disconnects them where they can or rejoin. I would really recommend to wait to download the app until these bugs have been fixed. Thankfully, they have said that instead of making an ‚ÄúAmomg us #2‚Äù they will wait of and be trying to fix these bugs instead. I would wait until around November, as they said that‚Äôs when it should be fixed. I also say you should be 12+ to have this game.

Just an interesting spin to make the game a little more addictive.  The little side quests like trophy challenges and the parrot gifts are super helpful. However I will say sometimes you are gifted 30 min unlimited game play and you don‚Äôt really have an option of when to use it. So if I am getting in a quick game on a break or before dinner and I am gifted one of those it goes to waste if I can‚Äôt continue to play for an extra 30 min.  Not going to lie, at those moments It really is frustrating because you get only 5 lives and the regeneration rate is slow. In addition the buy rate for items feels a little high. As an example to buy an extra 5 moves at the end of a tough level is 900 coins. You maybe get 55 coins for beating a level. So you have to tear through 18 levels to earn enough to buy that extension.  It actually de-incentivizes me to buy a package because it never really feels like you are getting a deal.  That being said if you can play and not get frustrated when you get stuck on a level for days, or are willing to pay for buy ups this game rocks.",However I will say sometimes you are gifted 30 min unlimited game play and you don‚Äôt really have an option of when to use it.,4,True,learnability,negative,6

Like in the beginning when I was trying to repair the entry hall, the can of paint spilled. I know that it only took 1 star to clean it up, but really? That part was a waste of coding and time for one little thing that they don‚Äôt need, and it was annoying. I just started playing, and I already like it, but I also see that it will be a little stubborn and slow at certain times. And in Austin‚Äôs room, when your done with it and everything looks new, there‚Äôs a dusty old desk that doesn‚Äôt go with the room, and I felt  like I should replace it, but I can‚Äôt. There were a few more parts that didn‚Äôt need to be there, but they put them there. Like when Austin‚Äôs dad stomps on the floor and breaks it, he they didn‚Äôt have to do that. Austin would have repaired it anyway. I am also confused about when Austin got to the house and went into his room and instead of a bed, there was a couch. Where did he sleep? Also, if nobody had lived in the house for years, why where the clothes on the statues not dusty? If you make another game from another game then shouldn‚Äôt you mention it?

Every day of every round I have to keep on pressing a X. Like STOP. Another thing is that the power ups are so short! They only last like five seconds. I think they could fix that in one of there updates. Oh speaking of updates, I love how they change the setting, but why CHANGE your high score. Like seriously! Come on man. My high score was like 80,000. Well HIGHER! They completely reset my high score. At first I was confused because I was proud of my high score, and trying to beat it, but then IT GOT RESET!

I don't want to stop playing but I run out of lives so I have no choice. Lol. I think I like it better than Gardenscapes and I love Gardenscapes too.  I like how you can put different types of explosives together or two of the same to make a bigger explosive. It would be even greater if you could put more than two together. I've had three explosives lined together but I can't mix all three together. I haven't had 4 or more alined but that would be more awesome. With Gardenscapes it seems like I'm not able to complete and able to upgrade or rebuild anything as quickly as I seem to be able to with Homescapes. So if you wanted to change something with Gardenscapes that would be one thing.  I guess it's a little harder to complete a level. You can't mix two explosives like you can with Homescapes. It's just totally different with the match game with Homescapes it seems to me. I love it and I can't get enough of it. I'm always wondering what the next level is going to be like.

For a relatively simple game, it creates surprising amounts of tension, and with the right group of players, the experience can be a total blast. So, why the mediocre rating? Innersloth recently released what I can only describe as a ruinous, game-breaking update. Firstly, disconnections are frequent; in a game whose structure relies upon every player living long enough to cast out the killer(s) before meeting either win/loss condition, losing those players to disconnection means one less pair of hands for tasks, one less vote per meeting, one less identity to hide among, or one less partner to kill crewmates. If it were just one, a person could grouse and learn to get over it. But it is many. The problem is large enough to merit redress. And there are game-ending graphical errors, too. From time to time, avatars glitch through/into walls, or walk into out-of-bounds areas. I even lost a game once where I thought I broke another player‚Äôs alibi because she claimed to be someplace, but she was plainly visible right next to me. Turns out she wasn‚Äôt a liar‚Äîmy game was just glitchy. Post-game glitches often mean rebooting and losing your lobby, which is the end of the world, but can be really demoralizing when you finally find a cool group to play with.

Also they do not have any type of communication system so you can‚Äôt talk to your opponents. That should be included in the game to communicate with your opponents, negotiate for trades, or just to simply remind your opponents to end the game.

As far as games go this is the most addicting mobile game I‚Äôve personally played. I‚Äôve enjoyed it  since this game came to iOS and have even purchased some in-game cosmetic gear. I just wanna say I appreciate the devs don‚Äôt give any pay to win options in the game. Some of the tasks are annoying and the maps need balancing I think. Other than that I think the gameplay is the strongest aspect of this game as it preys on our natural suspicions of others and that‚Äôs an amazing concept for strangers and friends to play. The biggest problem I‚Äôve had though, and the reason for the 3 star rating is due to the fact that I can hardly even get matches when I want to. I get error messages often saying I was dropped from the server or that the matchmaker is full. As someone who has put money into this game I find this unacceptable. I understand the rare server issue here and there but when it takes over 20 minutes to search for game I feel like I‚Äôm literally wasting time. This game was the number one ranked action game at one point and there are ads at the end of every match. Surely the devs need to work out a better deal with their current sponsors.

Then it kicks me out and says ‚ÄúThis server is full‚Äù I know you probably cannot stop this from happening. But I have no one else to talk to so I only have you guys.Update: Oh! And I forgot, sometimes people make servers and people join, only to get kicked or blocked by the host. I don‚Äôt understand why people do this. What do they get out of it you ask? Nothing. Can you please make a limit of how many people you can kick? Or perhaps rules I am sincerely sorry if this problem has been fixed.

I noticed the changes made to the game. And then when sunset arrived, memories came flooding back. The memories of summer nights spent with friends in this little world that taught us so much.

Unless you playing it nonstop without taking your eyes off the screen then it might take a few weeks. But that‚Äôs still a while. Also the hover boards. They can also get a little pricey. And why buy something that you can only use in certain times. It makes it worse that they can get really expensive. Honestly I think their pretty cool but please lower the prices. The last thing you might need to fix is the add lag. Sometimes it will start freezing up and you have to restart the app and that‚Äôs a little annoying in my opinion.

I think we should have an improvement or 2 (I‚Äôm not sure if it is 2, but it‚Äôs still worth the game) for this. It has an excellent interference facing the game but there can be simply a better idea for the game. Also, it has a awesome story. It tells about a person about a house that has to be renovated. This takes talent. The only way is that we did our skills. And the puzzles facing our ways. That‚Äôs the concert. To be honest, it also has days. This never happened in most games in my life. The only reason why because we have to fix the house. I don‚Äôt know why else. But it can also be dived into sections of the game. This is what a like so much. This app appears to be too similar to Candy Crush. But it has different things to do. And this is also having similar power ups. One more thing before closing the review. 900 coins is a lot for 5 moves. I think you need 1/3 of the amount (300 coins) and save 900 coins for 5 more moves and another thing.

It is just like the old monopoly I used to play except way faster because the money was automatically transferred. I do have some complaints though. If you‚Äôre gonna make an app cost money, don‚Äôt have in-app purchases that cost more than the game itself. There is some small details that I am slightly concerned about. If you spam click a property you want to mortgage then you lose money until you can‚Äôt click it anymore. When you are paying someone money it will do the transfer animation with the monopoly dollars but it will do the same animation no matter how much money was given/lost. The dice. I am slightly annoyed when they land on a flat surface when it should be landing on top of the buildings. It would be cool if the dice Didn't land on the buildings as if they were drawn onto the board. If they landed on top of the buildings that would be cool. These are just minor issues that I would be fine if they didn‚Äôt change. Over all, this was a great game to play with my family and I highly recommend playing it because you can pay 15 dollars for the real version or 4 bucks for a virtual version that goes faster.",I like this game.,4,True,general,positive,5

Minecraft is one of the best games out there at least for me it is. I basically grew up playing it on my xbox 360. Nothing wrong with the gameplay or anything. But I do have one complaint. Now i‚Äôm not entirely sure if this a bug or a glitch so it might be nothing but it bothers me. So basically I play on the server: MineVille City. And when i go into one the minigames, that minigame being High-School Roleplay there are problems with my custom skin. So idk if this has to do with the server but this has happened most of the time. I walk around and when i pull up the pause menu my custom skin is replaced with a random skin. And I sometimes see other players with my skin equipped. And idk if my skin is working or not. Even when i do the inventory menu my custom skin is still there. So Mojang, if you see this then please reach out to me. My Minecraft account is a Xbox live account named Endermen21YT. So please if you can, look into this. Now this could totally just be the server or something else so this might not even be happening. I‚Äôve even noticed that this has happened to other ppl before on those servers. And it only happens when I enter the minigame. In the main server my skin‚Äôs fine. So anyway yeah that‚Äôs all.

I wouldn‚Äôt give this game anything below 5 stars! But, there are a lot of things that concern me a little to. First, the over usage of bad words and #. It‚Äôs pretty hard to find a game where no one is constantly cussing inappropriate things in the chat, which ruins the game for everyone! On the other hand, there are some ridiculous hashtags marked on a word that isn‚Äôt even bad! Some people also put very disgusting things as their names. Another thing I would like to suggest is adding friends! Me and my friend just started playing together yesterday but it was very hard to get her into the same game as I am. Sometimes it‚Äôs very boring if we start a new game as host and no one‚Äôs joining!

The next thing i'd like to report is that when the imposter leaves in a meeting it won't automatically make the crewmates win, it will wait until the end of the meeting to crash everyone's game. The next thing is sabotaging bugs. The latest game i played it the imposter sabotaged O2 but then when it got to zero the numbers went onto negatives all the way to -11. The next important bug is when you are quick chatting, you might vote someone without knowing. The second to last thing i would like to share is on a mobile device when you first load in it just has part of the o and ng in, probably trying to say among us but it only says ong. Finally, the game is great and all, but i think the quick chat feature kind of got the game to become less popular, because you can't say what you want to say, or people just spam their quick chat thing so even when you say no one will see it or even believe it! You can't even say hi or talk about the latest game! Heck you can't even say gg!

However I did find more cons than pros. Let‚Äôs start off with finding a server. You have three different maps to choose from. You can also choose if you want to play with 1, 2, or 3 imposters. The imposter‚Äôs job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with ‚ÄúConfirm Ejects‚Äù and ‚ÄúVisual Tasks‚Äù on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says ‚Äú(insert anything here) was not An Imposter‚Äù or ‚Äúwas An Imposter‚Äù. With it being the imposter‚Äôs job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! This game is ruled by immature 12 year olds and when they get accused, they break lose. I am not exaggerating, I have heard the N word, the F word, and so many other ridiculously bad and racist words in this game than I did in the real world. The N word is a word that you will encounter. People think it‚Äôs okay if they leave the hard r out but it‚Äôs not. The N word is probably the most popular word in this game.

The hoverboard mechanic was very responsive even at the higher speed late game. The physics were doing great for a game, but now the hoverboard lags at times, I was in a super late game run where I attempted to activate the hoverboard and it didn‚Äôt work until my 4th attempt at double tapping. This wouldn‚Äôt have been an issue in the previous update. Also, the roofs can end your game even with a hoverboard? I have the monster board with the high jump ability and I made it admittedly higher than expected, but I just expected to lose the board and continue, but no it killed me entirely. The previous update where I did the same just passed me through no worries. If this is for added difficulty, I guess I can understand, but the fluidity the game once had is gone.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the quick chat was a good idea, but it doesn‚Äôt work as well as you would think. First off, its missing some crucial phrases and questions.

I thoroughly enjoy the puzzle aspect itself, more so than competing puzzle games. The animations are smoother, the power ups are well thought out and exciting to use, and the puzzles are fun. I'm docking points though, because the storylines are infuriating to deal with. What roped me in to downloading this game was the home decor aspect. As a huge fan of interior design, this seemed like the perfect game for me. I got to play fun levels, but also simultaneously get to decorate a home. However, after spending months on this game, and completing 240 levels, I've only just now unlocked the 3rd room. If you can even call it that. It goes living room, kitchen, and then garden? Why!? There are TONS of rooms in this house, and after TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTY levels, I'm decorating a garden while so much of the house is untouched. Don't even get me started on the baking storyline. 6 stars just to bake the cake base. Another 3 to bake the house cake. Another 3 to frost it. Another 3 to put it together. Then 2 to drive it to the studio. Then 2 to celebrate the win. Then another 2 to open a present for winning... it doesn't stop! I didn't download the game to bake a cake. I downloaded it to furnish a house! Stop with that nonsense. It took WEEKS to get through that ridiculous storyline. I hope the developers listen to this criticism, because it's really really turning me off to an otherwise fantastic game.","I thoroughly enjoy the puzzle aspect itself, more so than competing puzzle games.",3,True,enjoyability,positive,4

But I don‚Äôt usually spend any money on apps unless I know I‚Äôll use it. Well, I played a few days straight while stuck at home for a bit at Christmas. The AI is ok but it was playing against other people I was looking forward to! I won the first two times and thought that I was gonna really love playing this. As I played more and more I noticed some frustrating things. I don‚Äôt have to win all the time and make enough mistakes to know why I‚Äôve lost. But the inconsistency on the dice roll for all players is a predictable algorithm with no actual randomness. When I pay $4 I don‚Äôt except the world but I would have liked the opportunity to earn thru winning, other boards and pieces. No leaderboard or way to keep stats in this digital world was a surprise. I‚Äôm hoping for change as my thoughts seem to be repeated over and over again in the reviews.

This game takes the struggle out of someone having to be banker. A game dragging on for 10+hrs and people are always online playing. There were a few kinks with it in the beginning. But I am seeing that they are fixing it now. I am only giving it 4 stars because as of late a lot of the games I have been in the middle of playing will just not be able to resume. It will be someone else‚Äôs turn and they just never come out of their turn. I think their should be a time limit once they have handled they business. Otherwise you have to wait until they ‚Äúend turn‚Äù & this creates problems in the game. My games were all lost and needed to be exited after this occurred and all that I worked for or played for was lost. This creates a waste of time. Which is pretty unfortunate but other than that this game is extremely fun. I purchased both the other boards the snow and the 1930‚Äôs board I love all of them. Wish the tokens were a bit cheaper and more options. Overall few bug fixes and this game is going to remain my favorite.

As u rank up the more stars  u need to complete ONE task it‚Äôs not fair. Also I downloaded the game mainly to be able to redecorate the house and once you finish the kitchen you get sent outside to build the garden/ greenhouse. It is the most boring part of the game that takes FOREVER to finish. You can finish a room in 1-3 days of completion. But the outside has taken 6+ days to work on and I finally just gave up because of how many unnecessary tasks you have to complete just to get through one day. Every time u think your finally done with the outside theirs something stupid you have to still do. This game is only fun for a few days after that it‚Äôll just make you want to throw your phone in the garbage. Also the amount of coins you get for each level is unbelievable you should be able to get more the higher you level up but nope they just want you to try to buy their packages. Something no game will ever get out of me. As soon as games start to cheat you into wanting to spend your real money is when it gets deleted from my phone.

For example, when I‚Äôm trying to build a house I‚Äôd look and see if the cat coming down the road would land on either Baltic Ave or Boardwalk, and the one with the greater % I‚Äôd build the house on.

So me and her tried making a new game and it basically told us we had been M.I.A when the game hadn‚Äôt even loaded yet. Then we gave up. Later that day i by myself tried playing a game and it kept telling me I have an old version of the game even tho it just updated a day before. So that brings us to now.

Normally the game isn‚Äôt that slow but when ever I‚Äôm not on WiFi or have a poor connection , it takes 5 minutes to just to make the type of world that I want! Before the game would be a little slower than normal, but never THAT slow. I could be casually playing and it would glitch so bad, it would crash! And oddly enough when I try to pause the games it would take over 5 minutes for it to load the menu. Besides that, the gameplay is good, and the graphics are outstanding when you have a good internet connection. The servers are fun to play, and often has a variety of games on the servers. The game updates every once in a while and often features a fun new addition. And the in-game shop has a few free skins, worlds and has deals that are often good. However, when there isn‚Äôt a deal or a promotion for the shop the items can be quite expensive. The items range from 100 coins (0.99) to over 1,000 coins (around $20). Unless you are willing to put in money, you won‚Äôt have the more fun and interactive worlds/skins. TL;DRGood game overall. Has a fun shop with some free stuff and has fun updates.

There are a few problems though. To name a few, when you use an ad to revive, sometimes you will respawn you end up in an area where you are supposed to be on top of a train, so all 3 lanes have trains coming at you just to kill you again and the only way to survive is to waste a board so you can crash into a train. Also, parts of the game don‚Äôt make sense. For example, you‚Äôll jump over a barrier and then you‚Äôll see a train going down the same lane where the barrier is just to run over it. Trains will also appear out of nowhere. Keys are another huge problem. They are so rare to find and then if you don‚Äôt want to watch an ad to revive, you have to pay at least one key. As you keep dying, you need more and more keys to the point where the amount needed is insanely high. I also would like to see the game have challenges instead of only being able to run on an endless road.

For a relatively simple game, it creates surprising amounts of tension, and with the right group of players, the experience can be a total blast. So, why the mediocre rating? Innersloth recently released what I can only describe as a ruinous, game-breaking update. Firstly, disconnections are frequent; in a game whose structure relies upon every player living long enough to cast out the killer(s) before meeting either win/loss condition, losing those players to disconnection means one less pair of hands for tasks, one less vote per meeting, one less identity to hide among, or one less partner to kill crewmates. If it were just one, a person could grouse and learn to get over it. But it is many. The problem is large enough to merit redress. And there are game-ending graphical errors, too. From time to time, avatars glitch through/into walls, or walk into out-of-bounds areas. I even lost a game once where I thought I broke another player‚Äôs alibi because she claimed to be someplace, but she was plainly visible right next to me. Turns out she wasn‚Äôt a liar‚Äîmy game was just glitchy. Post-game glitches often mean rebooting and losing your lobby, which is the end of the world, but can be really demoralizing when you finally find a cool group to play with.

Why it‚Äôs A annoying. This update makes it hard to type and this so called safe environment is dum. If a player feels like they are getting attacked then they just leave the game and join a new one. If this does not work then they can play with friends or uninstall the game. Another thing is that it feels like you ‚Äú the among us savers ‚Äú are taking away freedom of speech. How?    If someone can‚Äôt say what they want to say about this or that it feels like you censored who that person,thing,or whatever is. However you might say this ‚Äúwell we also have it we‚Äôre if your 18 plus (example for age) you can say what you want to say ‚Äú and your right but but but most people that play this game are under 18 plus as of myself.

Getting around 50 coins per mini-game, which can take multiple lives to complete, isn‚Äôt sufficient enough. In order to buy a life, 900 coins, you would have to play around 18 rounds just to get enough coins for ONE life. I do not pay money on games, never have never will, but it‚Äôs so frustrating that you may have one move left and instead of paying real cash, not in game coins, you have to wait for a life to replenish just to try and fail at the level again. Each round can take 10+ lives to complete, and it takes quite awhile for the lives to replenish. There should be some kind of reward opportunity other than completing a day, especially because you need to play the mini-games to get stars, in order to complete tasks, to complete the day. That‚Äôs a lot of tasks to do with not a lot of lives/coin rewards!!! If there were events where you can play other mini-games to gain rewards/treasures I think it would be more efficient.

As the boards get harder we should get more stars, Hard=2 stars, Super Hard=3 stars and so forth, as we advance in the game tasks cost more stars so we should naturally EARN more stars to off set it!  Not keep us at 1 star per level, but the higher we go tasks are costing us 6-12 stars PER TASK, come on!! Same with the coins!

But you reach a certain point where you have to have boosters to beat the levels, & because Playtrix only gives you a max of 70 coins for each level beat (a taudry amount considering what things cost in the game), you end up spending  your own money  to be able to keep playing levels, or to be able to buy boosters to beat the levels. To break it down for you: I‚Äôm at level 122 (which is impossible to beat without a booster because of how it is set up), which is about midway through the 5th decoration level in the game (haven‚Äôt even broached the upstairs level yet). I‚Äôve already spent $60 on coins/boosters, & I‚Äôve only been playing 2 weeks. Not going to spend anymore $ on this (even though I enjoy it) simply on principle. The rewards for levels are not anywhere close to what they should be, & the amounts you get for what you pay for aren‚Äôt enough either. In other games if you spent $20 you would be set for a couple weeks. This game ends up being a days at most because of demand for boosters/coins to the cost ratio. I see this company fizzling out soon because of this. It‚Äôs a shame. They have a good game.

Now I can‚Äôt stop playing it. All I can say is thank you, bringing us entertainment for all these years. This game has been there sense the start and came out rough into the best sandbox game I have ever played. Sure there are some negatives about the game, like you can‚Äôt get custom skins off files on Xbox without having to decrepit the games files. I always had used MCPE skin creator/editor and it worked amazingly but sad to know I can only do it on mobile. But put that aside, and you have an overall 90/10 game right now for me it‚Äôs perfect as it is. Sadly the original creators of Minecraft are gone and now bough by another company, if your reading this you might say, the new company is bad.

Also, can you add a new character: Toon Bot?Toon Bot would be the normal robot body, like tagbot and tankbot,Just a few design changes. For the head, it would be a screen like a TV, changing facial expressions. The TV head would glitch, or bug out whenever the player is caught or damaged. The second costume for Toonbot would be a retro, video game style with a more modern, clean tv instead of an old, 1990 style tv. It would come with a new board witch would simply be a TV remote, special purchasable powers for the board would be zap sideways and super speed. This might add a but of modern-day style to the game.

The problem is you have to get stars from playing one game only. And even on a hard level you still get 1 star. It‚Äôs annoying how fast your stars run out. What‚Äôs even more annoying, it‚Äôs that sometimes you have to give one of your stars just to open a box, that you‚Äôve already given a star for box to get to the house! What I‚Äôm saying is give more chances to get stars. Like as a prize. Instead of just money, give us a little money and a star! Or have different games besides just the one game to match the colors.     Another thing is that it takes so long to complete one floor or one area of the house because of how limited of the stars you have. So I suppose you should just focus on the star problem because it will fix this one of taking so long! üòÜ     Please take this into consideration.

I believe it should be after the 7th day, you get all the prizes from day 1-6 at the same time, and then day 8 and on should have more until you reach every seventh day again. It‚Äôs a good way to make people play the game. There also need to be more tournaments that don‚Äôt give prizes based off places.

It‚Äôs just so fun and addicting. I just got it about three weeks ago and I haven‚Äôt stopped playing since. Although it‚Äôs a very well made very fun to play game, there‚Äôs some things that I think would be cool to add either to among us or among us 2. 1. There should be a way to kick people faster if you‚Äôre the host during a game. Some people like to call emergency meetings and waste time, so being able to kick them out would make it go by way faster. 2. I think it would be awesome to add a send a friend request button. Some people have really good friendships on here and a lot of the time one of them might disconnect or have to go and never see each other again! ;( If we had a add friend button, we could always play with them. Plus, when you try to give your personal number or social media‚Äôs out to someone, the whole server can see it unless you ban them all. 3. I think I saw this on another review, but maybe add a limit to camera time? It‚Äôs kinda hard to kill when people are guarding the cameras. 4. Hackers and exploiters should be automatically banned from playing. Maybe you could install a thing that detects their programming and stuff? They ruin the game a lot. Other than that, this game is amazing! Definitely game of the year. It‚Äôs made 2020 so much better. 5 stars for sure",I just got it about three weeks ago and I haven‚Äôt stopped playing since.,5,True,general,positive,5

I downloaded the latest update, got on it to check out all of the new features they added, but it went into super-lag mode, and won't really allow me to even legitimately play it. Usually, after trying to play for 30 seconds or so, the app will kick me, along with my iPod heating up A LOT. This is the only device I really have to play Minecraft PE on. So, I would really appreciate a fix in the next update that will improve the game efficiency-wise. And, next time there is a big update that will lag older devices, don't allow those devices to be updated. At least put it in the update details that it won't work on device x,y, and z (I did have automatic updates on, in fairness, but I have disabled auto-updates now). Honestly, I haven't had my device charged for a few days, and when I did, I turned all the graphics down, etc., and it helped. However, it makes the game very hard to enjoy, pretty much impossible for me. Very disappointed. It still does kick me, and the inventory menu stuff seems laggy and slow still. Will take a few seconds to work, and device still heats. Only reason not one star is because I didn't technically review the update features.

In fact, in one of my most recent games I ONLY LANDED ON THREE UN-PURCHASED PROPERTIES THE ENTIRE GAME, AND WAS OUT OF THE GAME RATHER QUICKLY!!!

Subway Surfers by Killow is just the app to get.  To start with I like all the powerups.  A powerup is a thing that you can get that can help you get more coins.  I like the jetpack powerup because it gives you lots of coins without the police officer chasing you.  I also like the magnet power up because you can get all the coins for a couple seconds without crashing. I also like how you can get keys.  Keys are things that are hard to get but you can get a lot of stuff with them like outfits and hoverboards.  For example, you can get characters with them.  I also like how you can get keys by doing stuff like getting 810 coins in one run you can get 8 keys.  Last of all, I like how you can watch videos to get things.  For example, you can watch a video every day to get two keys and you can also get super mystery boxes by watching videos too.  Last, I like  if you are at 0 coins or 0 keys, you can watch videos nonstop and get 10 keys in 15 minutes or get 10,000 coins in 20 minutes.  As you can see this is a very good game.

There are a lot of things in this game that you can spend real money on, but you certainly don‚Äôt have to buy them. I personally don‚Äôt spend money on games so I was very content with this. One of the things I don‚Äôt enjoy that much are like the bouncy shoe things, I know this is really minor but it kills me when I could‚Äôve gotten a lot further, what I‚Äôm talking about it sometimes when I‚Äôm wearing the bouncy shoe things I jump too high and bump into the bridge thing and die, which is kind of annoying.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong they‚Äôre great characters, but bumping down the price a little wouldn‚Äôt hurt. The second suggestion is offering more discounts on things like coins and prize boxes in the game. Maybe you could even call it Discount Day or Discount Week. The last suggestion is putting more missions in the game. Like for example, having the game players find LIMITED EDITION Gold boxes along the trail, that are filled with SUPER RARE things like unlocking special characters or getting a BIG amount of gems or coins. Other than these few suggestions, this game is amazingly fun! I like how it travels around the world to a new location every other month, and has characters that you buy from that specific location to go along with the theme!

The videos for coins rarely shows up now, too. When you get and use  power ups that can blow the whole screen, you can see how pieces only react to one object when they should have reacted and been removed due to multiples going off close enough to them. If you have single power ups, they explode pieces that do nothing to help complete the level. I will NEVER make a purchase in this game ever again, so I actually thank this game for making me see the light.

The small mini games shown in the ads are the best part but they are way too few and far between. The majority of this game is playing levels over and over trying to get the next star to fix the never ending repairs. I also found having to use stars to open packages annoying. If I‚Äôm getting a gift it should be just. There is some humor and the scenes are colorful which is why i gave it two stars. Had the earning of coins been much higher, the mini games much more prevalent, the bank either free to obtain or at least an option, the limiting of one star per repair and not having to use stars on anything other than repairs I could have seen playing this longer.

Board games in reality are fixed in many ways. For example, a deck of cards with a discard pile ensured that every card in the game will be played before a player can draw a second copy of any card. This also ensures equal odds of getting a card. This app takes the simpler approach of randomly generating the card on each draw. This means you may draw cards like ‚ÄúSpeeding Fine‚Äù two or three times in a row, while never pulling ‚ÄúAdvance To...‚Äù cards of any kind. The odds of card drawing seem to also favor the weaker cards. The developers assure that‚Äôs not true, but an easy way to restore faith would be to have the cards work with an actual deck and discard system instead of random generation upon each draw. To me, the purpose of this is to mimic the board game, if you wanted to change the fundamentals of the game then a different game mode would be nice. A ‚ÄúRandomized‚Äù mode could be fun along with the original two, but I would want the ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù mode to run like the classic board game. Otherwise, the game is functionally okay.

I love all of the updates and in my opinion the new update every one is complaining about is actually really good! But besides all of the amazing stuff my game has been glitching hardcore. So when I spawned into a survival world there was like the unfinished portal thing. Ofc I went to it to loot it and I got a golden pickaxe and sword. When I went to go mine coal it gave me the ore blocks instead of just coal. I didn‚Äôt think much of it until I went to go mine iron and it gave me nothing! This has been happening on every single one of my survival worlds. Maybe because it has Smite 1 on the golden pickaxe but if so why would you give that out to people? I stumbled across a village and went to go see if they had a furnace so I didn‚Äôt have to make one. Halfway through making cooking something in the Blast Furnace it just completely stopped. I tried taking everything out and putting them back in but no. I was really annoyed because I needed to cook food! Since it wasn‚Äôt working I decided to make a regular furnace. Checked the crafting recipe and it wanted a different block than cobble it wanted ‚ÄòBlackstone‚Äô? I didn‚Äôt even know that existed in the game! A lot other glitches have been happening I just can‚Äôt think of all of them right now. Those glitches stood out to me the most.

But even though they have been add new updates to Minecraft I feel they haven‚Äôt been adding things that really would make Minecraft wayyyyyyy better. I love the dolphins and turtles but couldn‚Äôt they add a few more like perhaps turkey or peacocks. I know you can easily get mods for these things but some cost money. I also think that they should add more dog breeds if there weren‚Äôt just a wolf I would have a lot more dogs. Like maybe they could have huskies pugs Pomeranians Shibas Chiwawas and Great Danes these are all great dog breeds. They could have which dog you get by the color of the wolf you tame like huskies would be white wolfs and Great Danes could be brown wolfs. I think you should also be able to tame polar bears turtles and dolphins and after you tame them you can saddle them and ride them. I also think that fish bowls should be a thing because if you catch a fish than you can put it in a fish bowl and depending on the amount of glass you use you get a different sized fish bowl.

It takes 5-10 minutes to get a game with few players that don‚Äôt curse, (so my friend or little sister can join) and nice settings, and sometimes I click on 2 imposters when I wanted 1 and I clicked on the wrong map, I think we should be able to change the map when we are host, just in case we misclicked, and we should be able  to change the amount of imposters!

Just when I thought I was finished in the garden, the story line STILL has more garden tasks. I really want to see more of the mansion! My daughter played this game as well and mostly stopped playing when the garden renovation began because she wanted to renovate the home. I can see how those with less patience would easily give up if they want home renovation instead of the garden. I'm on level 454 and have only renovated the butlers room, great room, kitchen, and stairs! Maybe the creators of the game could give players a choice on which room or area to continue with? Otherwise, I love the gameplay. Just stick to the idea of home renovation instead of branching to other story lines for so long.

They're pop-up, not videos, so they don't disrupt your game. However, like all games, this one has some problems. My biggest issue is the top run. Every week, the contestants get harder to beat, and eventually you can't get past the last person in the silver because they have over a million. Also, if you get a really good medal, like the diamond, you don't get to keep it for the next week because it changes depending on where you are that week. Another problem is the keys. To revive yourself, you have to pay more and more each time, until it gets so expensive that you can't even afford it. The only way to get keys is in the run, in mystery boxes, or in awards, which is a huge problem because: you only find a key in a run about every eighteen games or so, and if you miss it, then you don't have a chance to get another one. It is extremely rare to get a key in a mystery box, and when you do, it's only one, which can't even begin to pay for the expenses of reviving yourself. It takes a long time to earn a reward, which only gives you three keys, five if you're lucky.

This is not something that is acceptable on a free game but should be corrected immediately on a paid app.  While I enjoy the game, the fact that some many minutes and hours are wasted because games cannot be completed is totally unacceptable.  PLEASE FIX. Really enjoy Monopoly and love the game.  However reading the reviews, I find two issues that have popped up numerous times on other reviews that I am also experiencing also.  Since the last update, I have had several games that just freeze and you are out of luck.  What a waste of one, two hours plus, very frustrating.  The other really big issue is if you purchase the color block of Virginia, St Charles and States,  the Houses and Hotels tab covers Virginia and States and there is no way to add Houses and Hotels.

My ONLY complaint, if you play against the AI don‚Äôt expect to win. I‚Äôve won once because AI don‚Äôt get lucky and this is on EASY AI. You can have an entire side of the board and they will almost always land on a spot that is either safe or really low value. If you own the blue and brown by GO for example, they will often times go to JAIL therefore delaying coming close to those properties. Anytime they land on a CHANCE or COMMUNITY CHEST, they almost always get positive cards. They continuously try to trade you if they need a card so that can be tweaked.

Can the world tour travel to Malawi, Africa? My dad grew up there, and I would love to see how you design it. Also, can you add a new character: Toon Bot?Toon Bot would be the normal robot body, like tagbot and tankbot,Just a few design changes. For the head, it would be a screen like a TV, changing facial expressions. The TV head would glitch, or bug out whenever the player is caught or damaged. The second costume for Toonbot would be a retro, video game style with a more modern, clean tv instead of an old, 1990 style tv. It would come with a new board witch would simply be a TV remote, special purchasable powers for the board would be zap sideways and super speed. This might add a but of modern-day style to the game.

Although it‚Äôs a very well made very fun to play game, there‚Äôs some things that I think would be cool to add either to among us or among us 2. 1. There should be a way to kick people faster if you‚Äôre the host during a game. Some people like to call emergency meetings and waste time, so being able to kick them out would make it go by way faster. 2. I think it would be awesome to add a send a friend request button. Some people have really good friendships on here and a lot of the time one of them might disconnect or have to go and never see each other again! ;( If we had a add friend button, we could always play with them. Plus, when you try to give your personal number or social media‚Äôs out to someone, the whole server can see it unless you ban them all. 3. I think I saw this on another review, but maybe add a limit to camera time? It‚Äôs kinda hard to kill when people are guarding the cameras. 4. Hackers and exploiters should be automatically banned from playing. Maybe you could install a thing that detects their programming and stuff? They ruin the game a lot.

It gets annoying when I join only to be wearing their skin. Another thing is that the game constantly kicks me out. I‚Äôll be playing and my screen will freeze a lot.

I wouldn‚Äôt give this game anything below 5 stars! But, there are a lot of things that concern me a little to. First, the over usage of bad words and #. It‚Äôs pretty hard to find a game where no one is constantly cussing inappropriate things in the chat, which ruins the game for everyone! On the other hand, there are some ridiculous hashtags marked on a word that isn‚Äôt even bad! Some people also put very disgusting things as their names. Another thing I would like to suggest is adding friends! Me and my friend just started playing together yesterday but it was very hard to get her into the same game as I am. Sometimes it‚Äôs very boring if we start a new game as host and no one‚Äôs joining! I think it would be nice to friend request and then we can request our friends to be able to join the public server we are in! It would save a ton of time.

This time the app completely crashes every time it loads. It sends me right back to my home screen. Seriously. Someone help me out here. These sort of bugs have happened multiple times. I‚Äôve notified mojang and they just told me to delete and reinstall the app. They SHOULDN‚ÄôT have to tell me to DELETE the app. All the hard work üòÇüòì. Anyway, thank you for reading my comment.

But ever since Character Creator has been added to the game, my custom skins have been looking off. I use slim-armed skins because I prefer them over classic skins but the glitch only occurs on slim-armed skins. Let‚Äôs say you have a slim-armed skin, and you wanted a unique design on each leg. Like different-lengthened socks, or a flower on one and a star on the other. Then when you upload the skin on the game, whatever way you designed the right leg (it looks like the left leg if you look straight at the skin) gets copy and pasted automatically onto the left leg (right leg if you look at the skin straight at the face). It looks distorted, as I don‚Äôt know if other players can or cannot see the error besides yourself, but it‚Äôs basically both legs are symmetrical while a lot of skin designers like not making symmetrical, and the second layer on the leg that gets changed to looking like the other stays. So basically the glitched leg looks exactly like the other leg that looks perfectly fine, but has second layer on it. Like then both legs would have like a flower on it but the star‚Äôs second layer is stuck on top of the copy and pasted flower. Pretty odd right? For me it makes me feel like I have OCD, I can‚Äôt stand skins that have something off on it, sorry. It doesn‚Äôt do the glitch on classic skins though. So, if you can fix it, please do.","Like different-lengthened socks, or a flower on one and a star on the other.",5,True,general,positive,5

There should be a way to kick people faster if you‚Äôre the host during a game. Some people like to call emergency meetings and waste time, so being able to kick them out would make it go by way faster. 2. I think it would be awesome to add a send a friend request button. Some people have really good friendships on here and a lot of the time one of them might disconnect or have to go and never see each other again! ;( If we had a add friend button, we could always play with them. Plus, when you try to give your personal number or social media‚Äôs out to someone, the whole server can see it unless you ban them all. 3. I think I saw this on another review, but maybe add a limit to camera time? It‚Äôs kinda hard to kill when people are guarding the cameras. 4.

I do not pay money on games, never have never will, but it‚Äôs so frustrating that you may have one move left and instead of paying real cash, not in game coins, you have to wait for a life to replenish just to try and fail at the level again. Each round can take 10+ lives to complete, and it takes quite awhile for the lives to replenish. There should be some kind of reward opportunity other than completing a day, especially because you need to play the mini-games to get stars, in order to complete tasks, to complete the day.

The game is mostly playing a form of Candy Crush to earn stars in order to improve the home. That part is not so bad. The music is pleasant and the game is a relaxing time waster, at least initially. I don‚Äôt mind using the earned stars to replace furniture or a rug, but as the game goes on, you have to use the stars to do just about anything like answering the door, unpacking a TV, or even starting a new day. And once you‚Äôre out of stars, you can‚Äôt do anything else until you have won more candy crush games and earned more stars. You earn one star from winning each candy crush game no matter how difficult the game is. Win in one round, earn one star. Win after 20 rounds, earn one star. The idea of course is to get the player to purchase items to play longer. I get it. Most games I have seen do the same thing, but they don‚Äôt ramp up the difficulty so quickly.","The music is pleasant and the game is a relaxing time waster, at least initially.",3,True,enjoyability,positive,4

You start of committing a crime then the police chase you wich is fun! You can get keys that will revive you when you lose  and cool items that will help you along the way! It‚Äôs a really fun game that you should share with your friends and challenge each other. Sometimes you can even get a new high score. Something that really bothers me is that when I play a game and a battery thing pops up it will make me loose , but in this game it doesn‚Äôt! When the battery thing pops up , it gives you three seconds after that and and then you can play . When I get home from school I immediately want to play this game !

Two really cool characters I would LOVE to have you guys bring back is Mimi and Rabbot. I missed both of them and couldn‚Äôt get a chance to have them as characters. Speaking of Mimi, if I‚Äôm correct she does have a pet otter which is super cute. I don‚Äôt know if the otter runs with her when she is trying to evade the inspector, but if it does I think that the Subway Surfers team should have a pet isle where players can choose an animal to run with them like the inspector has a dog. I would absolutely DIE if that could happen. I also definitely think that younger players would enjoy this. Please consider because I think it will definitely draw more attention to this amazing game. Besides that I think this game has amazing graphics and deserves to have ‚Äúhype‚Äù I also like how you guys make different maps that represent different parts of the world.

It is very entertaining and sometimes I spend hours in a day playing it. The levels seem to get really difficult after you start renovating the third room. I really find it so frustrating that we have to wait 30 minutes for each life to come back. Also, the amount of moves given in each level is ridiculous. Sometimes, you need just 2 more moves to pass the level and you can‚Äôt because you‚Äôre out of moves. Then, if you want more, you have to pay 900 coins for only five more moves. And if you don‚Äôt have the money, you have to forfeit and loose the game. Other times, you can join competitions and get really cool power ups. If I get stuck on one of the levels in the challenges, I loose all my prizes and earned money. The point of the game is to be fun and decorate a house, which honestly is my favorite part of the game. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the matching part of the game is so fun too, I just hate the fact that you have to wait so long to get lives and some of the tasks they ask you to do are just ridiculous. As an example, if I got a cat in the game, it says I need to give a star just to name it. I mean that‚Äôs ridiculous.

This is not something that is acceptable on a free game but should be corrected immediately on a paid app.  While I enjoy the game, the fact that some many minutes and hours are wasted because games cannot be completed is totally unacceptable.  PLEASE FIX. Really enjoy Monopoly and love the game.  However reading the reviews, I find two issues that have popped up numerous times on other reviews that I am also experiencing also.  Since the last update, I have had several games that just freeze and you are out of luck.  What a waste of one, two hours plus, very frustrating.  The other really big issue is if you purchase the color block of Virginia, St Charles and States,  the Houses and Hotels tab covers Virginia and States and there is no way to add Houses and Hotels.  These are the two main issues that I have run into that others have as well.

It‚Äôs pretty bad when you start a match with no moves and it has to reshuffle. Power ups can be hit or miss at the start. Towards the higher levels you‚Äôll start off with a very small section and you‚Äôll have to open the rest of the field but you‚Äôll end up wasting 3 or 4 moves before you can even do that. Some levels seem impossible to beat without the RNG gods giving you tons of power ups. You‚Äôll often lose by 1 move which prompts you to use coins to buy 5 more moves. If you don‚Äôt have the coins, that‚Äôs when they hit you with the pay to win aspect of it. As many other people have said, it often feels like the game is working against you maliciously so you‚Äôll be forced to buy more coins or power ups. It gets extremely frustrating playing the same level thirty times and losing by 1 move over and over. This is the same for both gardenscapes and homescapes (and probably the other games by the same developers). Bottom lines is you can pretty much tell by mid match if you‚Äôre going to beat the level or not. If you still have 75% of the objectives to complete and you‚Äôve been forced to waste 3 or 4 moves in a row and you have less than 10 moves left, you‚Äôre not gonna win.

Another complaint I have is the only games rules we have to choose from are: Classic and Quick mode. It would be nice to have the options to change the rules/play custom games and whatnot.

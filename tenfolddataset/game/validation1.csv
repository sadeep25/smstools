Also, the ads that they show are not what the game is and I was disappointed to see them myself since I like the game a lot and wish they would just have ads that are what the game is. Instead, the game is a candy crush style game where you get stars and coins for every level you beat. With the stars you can customize your mansion and continue the story of a butler and his family. The coins are just meant to be saved up to buy power ups and refill lives (the lives regenerate). This has been an honest review of the game from me.P.S - Joining Houses/Teams is a very good idea because you get coins when teammates buy passes, and teammates can HELP you on levels your stumped on as well as give you lives when your out.","Instead, the game is a candy crush style game where you get stars and coins for every level you beat.",5,True,general,positive,5

But when you have 10 more moves left and you win the level you are lucky to win 58 coins?!?!  And you just better break out your dollars because some levels you will be killing yourselves to win. Like 498 level I am not going to spend anymore money on this game. And the few moves it gives you to play and the purple blocks that has the bugs in them good luck they get much harder in higher up levels. This level it has the regular white blocks that grow but the purple ones you have to kit them 2 to 3 times and they grow back just one to two moves after you remove another side. To get extra coins for more lives or boosters it is a lot of money for what little you get. 900 coins you get 3 this. And 1900 coins you get 3 globes.

The trades the A.I. players make are ridiculous and play after play they repeat over and over even if you silence them for that turn.  Real players wouldn‚Äôt do half of this stuff   Sometimes it appears that the dice roll is not random.  Sometimes the chance or community chest cards can be the same thing on back to back draws. Who goes first, second, third is flawed because it depends upon how you are listed and who rolls the highest dice when playing against the A.I players.   Not as much animation is needed which may help the battery drain or at least give an option to turn some of that off. So many things in each turn slow the whole game down and could be altered to keep it moving. Why not put the property cards displaying in the lower right rather than taking up the whole screen.

When I went to go mine coal it gave me the ore blocks instead of just coal. I didn‚Äôt think much of it until I went to go mine iron and it gave me nothing!

I tried taking everything out and putting them back in but no. I was really annoyed because I needed to cook food! Since it wasn‚Äôt working I decided to make a regular furnace. Checked the crafting recipe and it wanted a different block than cobble it wanted ‚ÄòBlackstone‚Äô? I didn‚Äôt even know that existed in the game!

There needs to be some sort of timer for everything so that way the game can keep moving or if someone doesn‚Äôt make any moves for a long period of time or purposely leaves the game they should go bankrupt and their properties should either get auctioned off or return back to the board for the other people to buy in the future.

It‚Äôs a great game to play with friends and family, whether you want to create a massive structure or survive in the wilderness while fighting monsters, or do a bit of both. However, like every game, it does need some improvements. First of all, I suggest that it have a wider variety of animals in the game, (elephants, lions, tigers, sharks, etc). Also, I think their should be more options of furniture, especially in creative mode, rather than having to use steps as chairs. There are also a few glitches that can be annoying. For example, if you add to many mobs in creative, it will lag out your game. Also, there was this one time that I had to delete and reinstall the game because it wouldn‚Äôt let me open up the game.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the quick chat was a good idea, but it doesn‚Äôt work as well as you would think. First off, its missing some crucial phrases and questions.

The reward to effort is completely unfair. The base reward is 50 coins while the cost for boosts, extended moves, or just about anything is 900 coins or more. Coins are sold in the shop for .99 cents per 900 which is crazy expensive considering 900 coins will on get 5 additional moves or 3 destroy balls (not sure what they are actually called). If 5 mores moves is not enough to complete the level the next 5 cost 1200 coins. The puzzles are designed to require boosts or additional moves. Each puzzle won rewards a star. Stars are required to perform actions for upgrading the garden or home. Though it is satisfying to watch the transformations and improvements I get frustrated when required to spend a star to greet someone at the door to receive a package, then another star to open the package. All the extra actions not related to actual upgrades seems like a complete waste of stars considering the difficulty of obtaining them.

No, I don‚Äôt want to pay extra for a new board or player piece...it‚Äôs just software. Give me a break.Second, there are some pretty bad playability issues. One is initiating trades; the user interface makes it impossible to pick multiple things on the left half of the screen because the player boxes cover the properties. Another is that tapping anywhere near the bottom right when trying to select one of your own properties causes the game to think you tapped the ‚Äúend turn‚Äù button, screwing up your turn. Another horrible gameplay thing is the fact that AI players constantly choose ‚Äúauction‚Äù instead of buying properties outright, which is not at all like how people in real life play the game. Not only that, but the AI player that initiated the auction will bid all the way up to the original cost of the property...why on earth would anyone ever do that? Sloppy gameplay for sure.The older Monopoly game on the App Store, which I purchased long ago, was quite a bit better.

There are a few problems though. To name a few, when you use an ad to revive, sometimes you will respawn you end up in an area where you are supposed to be on top of a train, so all 3 lanes have trains coming at you just to kill you again and the only way to survive is to waste a board so you can crash into a train. Also, parts of the game don‚Äôt make sense. For example, you‚Äôll jump over a barrier and then you‚Äôll see a train going down the same lane where the barrier is just to run over it.

Now, after updating the game from not playing it for over a year, the game lags for seemingly no reason (it runs smoother with the internet turned off and turning off multiplayer seems to make little difference). Some sounds are still present in the game but some sounds don't play at all such as picking up blocks or when you get hurt or die. Enemies do not make unique sounds when hit and has a seemingly stock sound effect playing. I have not had problem with infinite maps before; however, I now have problems with all maps. The game only feels playable when all high end settings are disabled, mob spawning is disabled, and setting gameplay to peaceful. In addition, the UI is not touch screen friendly like it was in the alpha and beta. I know that I am using old hardware but this many problems for a game that ran otherwise smoothly in the past is ridiculous. One final criticism is that unlike the alpha and beta there are only two rendering options that make the hot bar look pointless: 5 and 6. Make it 1 to 6 so that old players such as myself can play the game optimally.

I also think it would be really cool if we could use this currency to buy higher imposter chances because I would love if I could do that.

Multiple people play together and say who is the imposter and some hackers are being able to kill in the middle of meetings and do visuals as imposter. Another reason is that there are no new maps.

Everyone thought it would come out in January or February, but it‚Äôs March and it still hasn‚Äôt come out yet. Another reason is that the new chat update can‚Äôt let you talk freely.

Some times, I have to spend like 20 minutes trying to connect my game. People say it‚Äôs my bad wifi, but that‚Äôs not true because my wifi works perfectly fine.

The imposter‚Äôs job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with ‚ÄúConfirm Ejects‚Äù and ‚ÄúVisual Tasks‚Äù on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says ‚Äú(insert anything here) was not An Imposter‚Äù or ‚Äúwas An Imposter‚Äù.

Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! This game is ruled by immature 12 year olds and when they get accused, they break lose. I am not exaggerating, I have heard the N word, the F word, and so many other ridiculously bad and racist words in this game than I did in the real world.

I had a property of every color in my last game to ensure no one can build, so what happens? Yup, I land on their railroads only. So what do I do? I buy one of their railroads for a ridiculous price.

It‚Äôs pretty bad when you start a match with no moves and it has to reshuffle. Power ups can be hit or miss at the start. Towards the higher levels you‚Äôll start off with a very small section and you‚Äôll have to open the rest of the field but you‚Äôll end up wasting 3 or 4 moves before you can even do that. Some levels seem impossible to beat without the RNG gods giving you tons of power ups. You‚Äôll often lose by 1 move which prompts you to use coins to buy 5 more moves. If you don‚Äôt have the coins, that‚Äôs when they hit you with the pay to win aspect of it. As many other people have said, it often feels like the game is working against you maliciously so you‚Äôll be forced to buy more coins or power ups. It gets extremely frustrating playing the same level thirty times and losing by 1 move over and over. This is the same for both gardenscapes and homescapes (and probably the other games by the same developers). Bottom lines is you can pretty much tell by mid match if you‚Äôre going to beat the level or not. If you still have 75% of the objectives to complete and you‚Äôve been forced to waste 3 or 4 moves in a row and you have less than 10 moves left, you‚Äôre not gonna win.

To name a few, when you use an ad to revive, sometimes you will respawn you end up in an area where you are supposed to be on top of a train, so all 3 lanes have trains coming at you just to kill you again and the only way to survive is to waste a board so you can crash into a train. Also, parts of the game don‚Äôt make sense. For example, you‚Äôll jump over a barrier and then you‚Äôll see a train going down the same lane where the barrier is just to run over it. Trains will also appear out of nowhere. Keys are another huge problem. They are so rare to find and then if you don‚Äôt want to watch an ad to revive, you have to pay at least one key. As you keep dying, you need more and more keys to the point where the amount needed is insanely high. I also would like to see the game have challenges instead of only being able to run on an endless road.

It‚Äôs so fun and the strategy involved makes it more exciting to play. It also gives such a rush of adrenaline. But whilst this game is structured beautifully and an incredible game, I do have a few small tips that I think could make this game better than it already is. First of all, an add friend button. Me and my friends love playing servers together and being able to friend other users could make it easier to game together. Also a microphone feature would be great. Chatting with the other users whilst playing out loud could be really great, because you‚Äôd be talking instead of typing through a screen. You‚Äôd be able to pick a game with microphone chatting or without, just whatever you prefer personally. Also being to branch out into private chats with people in the server would be really good. That way you could discuss plans with fellow imposters and win in a better and more strategized way. Also you could chat with friends you‚Äôre playing with separately. It would add a better feature of strategy and even betrayal to the game. You could even use it for persuasion purposes. Those are a few small but very effective features I think us among us users would love and highly appreciate! Thank you for this amazing game and I hope you take into account these suggestions!","Chatting with the other users whilst playing out loud could be really great, because you‚Äôd be talking instead of typing through a screen.",5,True,general,positive,5

Just an interesting spin to make the game a little more addictive.  The little side quests like trophy challenges and the parrot gifts are super helpful. However I will say sometimes you are gifted 30 min unlimited game play and you don‚Äôt really have an option of when to use it. So if I am getting in a quick game on a break or before dinner and I am gifted one of those it goes to waste if I can‚Äôt continue to play for an extra 30 min.  Not going to lie, at those moments It really is frustrating because you get only 5 lives and the regeneration rate is slow. In addition the buy rate for items feels a little high. As an example to buy an extra 5 moves at the end of a tough level is 900 coins. You maybe get 55 coins for beating a level. So you have to tear through 18 levels to earn enough to buy that extension.  It actually de-incentivizes me to buy a package because it never really feels like you are getting a deal.  That being said if you can play and not get frustrated when you get stuck on a level for days, or are willing to pay for buy ups this game rocks.",As an example to buy an extra 5 moves at the end of a tough level is 900 coins.,4,True,cost,negative,1

It is very entertaining and sometimes I spend hours in a day playing it. The levels seem to get really difficult after you start renovating the third room. I really find it so frustrating that we have to wait 30 minutes for each life to come back. Also, the amount of moves given in each level is ridiculous. Sometimes, you need just 2 more moves to pass the level and you can‚Äôt because you‚Äôre out of moves. Then, if you want more, you have to pay 900 coins for only five more moves. And if you don‚Äôt have the money, you have to forfeit and loose the game. Other times, you can join competitions and get really cool power ups. If I get stuck on one of the levels in the challenges, I loose all my prizes and earned money. The point of the game is to be fun and decorate a house, which honestly is my favorite part of the game. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the matching part of the game is so fun too, I just hate the fact that you have to wait so long to get lives and some of the tasks they ask you to do are just ridiculous.

The animation is lovely, the load times are quick, and, of course, Monopoly is just fun to play. My only quibble is the programming of the computer players. As far as I can tell, the only differences between the easy and hard modes are the likelihood that the computer players will elect not to buy a property or make a bizarre trade. I find that the game is artificially difficult at times because the computer players frequently make unreasonable trades that savvy human players would never make. For example, Dog will make a trade with Penguin that gives Penguin an orange monopoly (at a time when Penguin has tons of money and can immediately build it up to four houses per property). In exchange, Dog got a second red property that Dog can‚Äôt do anything with (because I have the third red property). So Dog gives Penguin an almost insurmountable advantage early in the game for no obvious strategic reason. It seems like a minor gripe in the grand scheme of things, but similar scenarios happen fairly often, which makes the game less fun at times.","The animation is lovely, the load times are quick, and, of course, Monopoly is just fun to play.",4,True,enjoyability,positive,4

Innersloth recently released what I can only describe as a ruinous, game-breaking update. Firstly, disconnections are frequent; in a game whose structure relies upon every player living long enough to cast out the killer(s) before meeting either win/loss condition, losing those players to disconnection means one less pair of hands for tasks, one less vote per meeting, one less identity to hide among, or one less partner to kill crewmates. If it were just one, a person could grouse and learn to get over it. But it is many. The problem is large enough to merit redress. And there are game-ending graphical errors, too. From time to time, avatars glitch through/into walls, or walk into out-of-bounds areas. I even lost a game once where I thought I broke another player‚Äôs alibi because she claimed to be someplace, but she was plainly visible right next to me.

It‚Äôs pretty bad when you start a match with no moves and it has to reshuffle. Power ups can be hit or miss at the start. Towards the higher levels you‚Äôll start off with a very small section and you‚Äôll have to open the rest of the field but you‚Äôll end up wasting 3 or 4 moves before you can even do that. Some levels seem impossible to beat without the RNG gods giving you tons of power ups. You‚Äôll often lose by 1 move which prompts you to use coins to buy 5 more moves. If you don‚Äôt have the coins, that‚Äôs when they hit you with the pay to win aspect of it. As many other people have said, it often feels like the game is working against you maliciously so you‚Äôll be forced to buy more coins or power ups. It gets extremely frustrating playing the same level thirty times and losing by 1 move over and over. This is the same for both gardenscapes and homescapes (and probably the other games by the same developers). Bottom lines is you can pretty much tell by mid match if you‚Äôre going to beat the level or not. If you still have 75% of the objectives to complete and you‚Äôve been forced to waste 3 or 4 moves in a row and you have less than 10 moves left, you‚Äôre not gonna win.

Turning off would be nice too, especially for short games. *When making mortgage and housing decisions it would be useful to be able to see the other players positions on the board. *There is a bug that the cards that say pay or collect from another player, do not impact the other players.*Winning games should unlock some of the features that are asking for payment.*The speedier computer rolls are appreciated, we still need to be able to tap and skip animations. *I‚Äôd also like a mode where the properties are distributed for a faster game.*The computer traded properties with the same judgment between person and computer.  *Rather than rejecting trades, offer more counter offers. Stop requesting counter offers of ridiculous amounts like $1 when making offers.","*There is a bug that the cards that say pay or collect from another player, do not impact the other players.",5,True,cost,negative,1

Some of the hard levels are easy or perhaps it‚Äôs just luck to win them.  I have spent days on a level and get frustrated and then dont play for a while...but i still really enjoy this game.  You CAN win every level with out a power up.  You DO NOT need to spend any money on this game, patience is a virtue (so they say).  I have spent money and lately I haven‚Äôt.  The one thing i do agree with most reviewers on is this... to buy a power up costs wayyy too much money for the amount of coins you receive for passing a level.  To continue a game (at 900 coins) for a move or two costs a fortune considering you really don‚Äôt win much.  To buy three hammers costs too much (1900 coins).  I realize they do want you to spend money and i have but even when you spend, it doesn‚Äôt give you much in return.

Seriously, no chat box? No ability to use our microphones? You want to charge $4 for a board game and not let us speak to each other? They‚Äôre also charging $30 for a season pass that I believe features strictly cosmetics. üôÑ Marmalade, if you want our money at least give us a solid game. Another complaint I have is the only games rules we have to choose from are: Classic and Quick mode. It would be nice to have the options to change the rules/play custom games and whatnot. To the Monopoly fans, tread carefully because this game was clearly developed as a cash grab and not to give us the mobile Monopoly we would expect in 2020.

I played when hunger bars didn't exist. When it would be that if you move in water you swim up, when mobs could attack you from underwater or well let's say I was really deep into the ocean. The zombie just attacks me if I am under it. When you couldn't well screw it I just played for a long time let's say that. A suggestion? The launcher like choosing a mcpe version you like.  Just like java. Also please add the option to remove features and mobs without turning cheats on. Let's say I removed drowned. Cheats don't turn off. If I remove all hostile mobs. Never.

So here's what happened: I was playing Subway Surfers for most of the day, during car rides and stuff, whenever I had a little free time. But on this day I just couldn't die. I used over 80 hoverboards, 1 key and amassed over 4000 coins and a wrecking 3 million score. This was done over a accumulated time of two hours. It was awesome. But I had to go to sleep. I left the app open with my phone charging and went to bed. The next morning, I went straight to my phone, unlocked it, and since it was left on Subway Surfers, it went to Subway Surfers.  Here is where I know most people would be incredibly angry; this is a 3-million-2-hour-score, you know? Instead of going to the ""paused"" part, the app RESTARTED!!! I could've thrown my phone, thrown chairs or whatever, but here I am writing a review. I haven't played the app since, and here's additional information: So I also have the game 2048. Even if you restart the app, restart your phone, or your phone dies, your progress WOULD NEVER BE LOST!!! EVER! Why can Subway Surfers be like that?

It is fun and easy to learn how to play, and it kills time while making us think. I believe the new tournaments are fun, but it needs more. The levels need to make it so more coins can be earned. If I earn the minimum coins per level (50) and play 10 levels, it still isn‚Äôt enough to get a retry on a particularly hard level. Now I do think the fact they are called ‚ÄúHard Levels‚Äù makes it better for us to prepare, and definitely the coin amount there is worth it. But in order to pass a level, I spend almost 6-8 hearts if it‚Äôs extremely time-consuming and hard. There is still the issue with more prizes. I like the daily bonus, but after the seventh day, it sent me right back to the first day without any prizes. I believe it should be after the 7th day, you get all the prizes from day 1-6 at the same time, and then day 8 and on should have more until you reach every seventh day again. It‚Äôs a good way to make people play the game. There also need to be more tournaments that don‚Äôt give prizes based off places. I never get first place in the plane tournament, but in the knitting ball one, I got a lot of prizes and it made me feel more encouraged to try. This game is great but definitely needs more to attract more and lose less people.","It is fun and easy to learn how to play, and it kills time while making us think.",4,True,general,positive,5

With 2 players bankrupt, me having a thousand dollars minimum 2-4 monopolies all with a few houses and hotels. The other player is generally just as good. But, something changes. For some reason the AI just so happens to just the correct numbers to avoid my hotels/2-4 houses...for like 6 rotations to the board... they literally almost never land on my properties when there is only one AI left.  Me in contrary, is landing on every single one of their and gets all the chance cards which make me pay more. The chance cards they land on gives them money no matter what in the endgame.

Minecraft just got boring because there were no other items that are really decorative, like when you want to build a house, you needed a toilet. But there is no toilet in Minecraft. Mods like Decocraft mod and Bibliocraft mod have many other items that are decorative for a house, but sadly there are no mods for Minecraft PE. What I mean by this is that mods don't work on Minecraft PE. There are only Addons, but really Addons just REPLACE other items. Please add more items like toilets or TVs and more in Minecraft!

Also when you get into the game more, it takes so much longer to finish a day, it‚Äôll be like 6% closer to rewards when you win a level. Also I don‚Äôt like how we only have five lives. I feel like we should have more lives than only 5! The game‚Äôs really fun but there is some stupidity to it like tasks cost so much, but u only get one star for each level, and for every normal level, 50 coins. But if you want more moves after you use them all up, it costs 900 coins. I think that is way too expensive. And I hate how long it takes for lives to refill! Like, 30 minutes to wait for one live! Also, for the harder levels, I think that we should get more stars, not only one!! I think that if they‚Äôre going to go all the way and say that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúsuper hard level‚Äù then they should act like it and give more stars once the level is completed!!

It‚Äôs so fun and the strategy involved makes it more exciting to play. It also gives such a rush of adrenaline. But whilst this game is structured beautifully and an incredible game, I do have a few small tips that I think could make this game better than it already is. First of all, an add friend button. Me and my friends love playing servers together and being able to friend other users could make it easier to game together. Also a microphone feature would be great. Chatting with the other users whilst playing out loud could be really great, because you‚Äôd be talking instead of typing through a screen. You‚Äôd be able to pick a game with microphone chatting or without, just whatever you prefer personally. Also being to branch out into private chats with people in the server would be really good. That way you could discuss plans with fellow imposters and win in a better and more strategized way. Also you could chat with friends you‚Äôre playing with separately. It would add a better feature of strategy and even betrayal to the game. You could even use it for persuasion purposes. Those are a few small but very effective features I think us among us users would love and highly appreciate!

The levels are so hard and the payout is so low. I‚Äôm deleted the game today because I don‚Äôt spend ‚Äúreal‚Äù money on games, especially when there isn‚Äôt a good return. The amount of coins that are needed to buy things like boosters and lives are crazy high. 900 coins for 5more moves on a level is crazy and then if you want to do it again, it‚Äôs 1200! When you only win between 50 and 100 coins ( on a really good round) it takes a really long time to recoup. They are very stingy with giving you boosters and chances to get more coins. I play other games that are very generous with coins and boosters which allows me to play and enjoy the game. Isn‚Äôt that what the game should be all about? Challenging levels are one thing, but when it takes so many lives to win a level it‚Äôs not fun anymore. I won 2 hours, played constantly for that time and only made it through 2 levels. Also, when you win 2or 3 hours of free play, it should be put away so I can play when I want to. If I win 3lives on the wheel, it gets put away...I should be able to play an hour at a time when I want to play....I worked hard to win those hours and I should be able to play them.

That was before level 1913. I liked it because I could always advance. Beating difficult levels may have taken MULTIPLE attempts but didn‚Äôt require having to spend money. However, within the game there are weekly contests where you‚Äôre placed on teams. The better you do the higher your team level placement. When you‚Äôre ranked in the lower levels I‚Äôm convinced this game randomly ‚Äúloosens up‚Äù and you‚Äôre able to go on winning streaks (doing so allows you to accumulate coins to help Austin fix the house, which is the point of the game, right?). Likewise, I‚Äôm convinced when you do well and find yourself in a higher level, the game ‚Äútightens up‚Äù and it‚Äôs impossible to win any level without spending coin, either real or earned. When I got to level 1913 I got placed in the highest ranking level.

It‚Äôs pretty bad when you start a match with no moves and it has to reshuffle. Power ups can be hit or miss at the start. Towards the higher levels you‚Äôll start off with a very small section and you‚Äôll have to open the rest of the field but you‚Äôll end up wasting 3 or 4 moves before you can even do that. Some levels seem impossible to beat without the RNG gods giving you tons of power ups. You‚Äôll often lose by 1 move which prompts you to use coins to buy 5 more moves. If you don‚Äôt have the coins, that‚Äôs when they hit you with the pay to win aspect of it. As many other people have said, it often feels like the game is working against you maliciously so you‚Äôll be forced to buy more coins or power ups. It gets extremely frustrating playing the same level thirty times and losing by 1 move over and over. This is the same for both gardenscapes and homescapes (and probably the other games by the same developers). Bottom lines is you can pretty much tell by mid match if you‚Äôre going to beat the level or not. If you still have 75% of the objectives to complete and you‚Äôve been forced to waste 3 or 4 moves in a row and you have less than 10 moves left, you‚Äôre not gonna win.

If you play like 5 games in a row with someone and you‚Äôre bonding with them, maybe you have to go or maybe they have to go, or if you get kicked or something, you never get to see each other ever again. Also it could be the same thing except with friends. And maybe you can see if you‚Äôre friends (in the game) are playing. 3. Newer stuff, like new colors, tasks and hats would be absolutely amazing!

I just thought of a few new mobs I would like for the developers to add into Minecraft! I hope they at least add in one of them. 1. Skele-Fish. It is a fish that can be found in all water sources in every biome, except for swamps. It can only spawn in when the world is in easy, normal, or hard. It can drop up to 3 bones when killed, it doesn‚Äôt attack you unless if you attack it first,  (just like when you hit a wolf in survival when it isn‚Äôt tamed to anyone in that world) it deals three hearts when it attacks you, and it has a body made of bones with no eyes. 2. Black Bear. A bear with a brown snout, brown belly, and all the rest is black fur. It can only be found in Taiga (spruce forest) biomes. It has the same body that the polar bear does. It eats raw fish of any type and sweet berries, but you cannot tame them, you can only breed them (just like the foxes). They can spawn when the world is in peaceful, easy, normal, or hard. But when it is peaceful, when you attack them they won‚Äôt attack you back. But when it isn‚Äôt in peaceful when you attack one, they deal 4 hearts when the player is in survival. 3. Penguin. It only spawns in snowy plains and on icebergs. They eat raw fish of any type, but you cannot tame them, you can only breed them. They have a white belly and the rest is all-black. They do not attack you when you hit them in easy, normal, or hard.","But when it isn‚Äôt in peaceful when you attack one, they deal 4 hearts when the player is in survival.",5,True,general,negative,5

They're pop-up, not videos, so they don't disrupt your game. However, like all games, this one has some problems. My biggest issue is the top run. Every week, the contestants get harder to beat, and eventually you can't get past the last person in the silver because they have over a million. Also, if you get a really good medal, like the diamond, you don't get to keep it for the next week because it changes depending on where you are that week. Another problem is the keys. To revive yourself, you have to pay more and more each time, until it gets so expensive that you can't even afford it. The only way to get keys is in the run, in mystery boxes, or in awards, which is a huge problem because: you only find a key in a run about every eighteen games or so, and if you miss it, then you don't have a chance to get another one. It is extremely rare to get a key in a mystery box, and when you do, it's only one, which can't even begin to pay for the expenses of reviving yourself. It takes a long time to earn a reward, which only gives you three keys, five if you're lucky.

Board games in reality are fixed in many ways. For example, a deck of cards with a discard pile ensured that every card in the game will be played before a player can draw a second copy of any card. This also ensures equal odds of getting a card. This app takes the simpler approach of randomly generating the card on each draw. This means you may draw cards like ‚ÄúSpeeding Fine‚Äù two or three times in a row, while never pulling ‚ÄúAdvance To...‚Äù cards of any kind. The odds of card drawing seem to also favor the weaker cards. The developers assure that‚Äôs not true, but an easy way to restore faith would be to have the cards work with an actual deck and discard system instead of random generation upon each draw. To me, the purpose of this is to mimic the board game, if you wanted to change the fundamentals of the game then a different game mode would be nice. A ‚ÄúRandomized‚Äù mode could be fun along with the original two, but I would want the ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù mode to run like the classic board game. Otherwise, the game is functionally okay.

When adding houses to the purple properties, the add houses button extends over the purple properties making it difficult to add properties there. I find myself accidentally not buying a property because the buy or not buy buttons are too close together. Maybe a different layout for buying properties. For games against the computer it would be nice to limit the number of times the computer offers a trade. It gets to the point where it is offering trades on every dice roll which slows the game down. For the custom rule set, having an option to start the game with more money would be nice.

Now all the ads I see for this game don't make sense.

I used over 80 hoverboards, 1 key and amassed over 4000 coins and a wrecking 3 million score. This was done over a accumulated time of two hours. It was awesome. But I had to go to sleep. I left the app open with my phone charging and went to bed. The next morning, I went straight to my phone, unlocked it, and since it was left on Subway Surfers, it went to Subway Surfers.  Here is where I know most people would be incredibly angry; this is a 3-million-2-hour-score, you know? Instead of going to the ""paused"" part, the app RESTARTED!!!

This game takes the struggle out of someone having to be banker. A game dragging on for 10+hrs and people are always online playing. There were a few kinks with it in the beginning.

It is very entertaining and sometimes I spend hours in a day playing it. The levels seem to get really difficult after you start renovating the third room. I really find it so frustrating that we have to wait 30 minutes for each life to come back. Also, the amount of moves given in each level is ridiculous. Sometimes, you need just 2 more moves to pass the level and you can‚Äôt because you‚Äôre out of moves. Then, if you want more, you have to pay 900 coins for only five more moves. And if you don‚Äôt have the money, you have to forfeit and loose the game. Other times, you can join competitions and get really cool power ups. If I get stuck on one of the levels in the challenges, I loose all my prizes and earned money. The point of the game is to be fun and decorate a house, which honestly is my favorite part of the game. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the matching part of the game is so fun too, I just hate the fact that you have to wait so long to get lives and some of the tasks they ask you to do are just ridiculous.

It‚Äôs pretty bad when you start a match with no moves and it has to reshuffle. Power ups can be hit or miss at the start. Towards the higher levels you‚Äôll start off with a very small section and you‚Äôll have to open the rest of the field but you‚Äôll end up wasting 3 or 4 moves before you can even do that. Some levels seem impossible to beat without the RNG gods giving you tons of power ups. You‚Äôll often lose by 1 move which prompts you to use coins to buy 5 more moves. If you don‚Äôt have the coins, that‚Äôs when they hit you with the pay to win aspect of it. As many other people have said, it often feels like the game is working against you maliciously so you‚Äôll be forced to buy more coins or power ups.

This is the same for both gardenscapes and homescapes (and probably the other games by the same developers).

But, it is good that the hard and extra hard are few and far between, so it‚Äôs not overwhelming, it‚Äôs a good change of pace. And, as others have said, rewards are few and far between as well.

I know you have to make money in this venture, but, your doing it to the detriment of your customers.  There is a reason we play games that say that they are free, it‚Äôs because a lot of us do not have the funds to use actual money to progress farther in the game faster then the other players that can afford to use their hard earned money.

I think you should also make a new map or an hide and seek map for the people who play hide and seek. Otherwise it‚Äôs great! Also I think there should be a way to friend people, because I met some really nice people , but when I disconnected I never saw them again, they were so nice that when I was Imposter they let me win! But also there is a glitch, I join a game with one player (that‚Äôs what it says) but it turns out to be full! It takes 5-10 minutes to get a game with few players that don‚Äôt curse, (so my friend or little sister can join) and nice settings, and sometimes I click on 2 imposters when I wanted 1 and I clicked on the wrong map, I think we should be able to change the map when we are host, just in case we misclicked, and we should be able  to change the amount of imposters!

For the head, it would be a screen like a TV, changing facial expressions. The TV head would glitch, or bug out whenever the player is caught or damaged. The second costume for Toonbot would be a retro, video game style with a more modern, clean tv instead of an old, 1990 style tv.

That price is more content. People need more and more content and if the demand isn‚Äôt met with even small additions like new tasks or new colors for characters then the game will slowly start to die out. A big thing people want is the ability to have friends. You can play like 40 games with the same person and really bond with them and get to know them, only for both of you to be kicked out of the game for an update or hacking or something and you‚Äôd never be able to see them again.

I realize that it breaks up the monotony, but, I spend days sometimes trying to beat the level.  But, it is good that the hard and extra hard are few and far between, so it‚Äôs not overwhelming, it‚Äôs a good change of pace. And, as others have said, rewards are few and far between as well.  Especially with the hard levels, the rewards are just this: your normal level low coin reward is doubled and you are rewarded with one extra star.  I know you have to make money in this venture, but, your doing it to the detriment of your customers.  There is a reason we play games that say that they are free, it‚Äôs because a lot of us do not have the funds to use actual money to progress farther in the game faster then the other players that can afford to use their hard earned money.  In conclusion, I think this game is well worth 5 stars, however, I did only give it 4 stars on account of the hard and very hard levels & the lack of well deserved rewards.  I think there should be better rewards and it should be a little easier to get stars.  Just my opinion for what it‚Äôs worth.

If 5 mores moves is not enough to complete the level the next 5 cost 1200 coins. The puzzles are designed to require boosts or additional moves. Each puzzle won rewards a star. Stars are required to perform actions for upgrading the garden or home. Though it is satisfying to watch the transformations and improvements I get frustrated when required to spend a star to greet someone at the door to receive a package, then another star to open the package. All the extra actions not related to actual upgrades seems like a complete waste of stars considering the difficulty of obtaining them.

One is initiating trades; the user interface makes it impossible to pick multiple things on the left half of the screen because the player boxes cover the properties. Another is that tapping anywhere near the bottom right when trying to select one of your own properties causes the game to think you tapped the ‚Äúend turn‚Äù button, screwing up your turn. Another horrible gameplay thing is the fact that AI players constantly choose ‚Äúauction‚Äù instead of buying properties outright, which is not at all like how people in real life play the game. Not only that, but the AI player that initiated the auction will bid all the way up to the original cost of the property...why on earth would anyone ever do that? Sloppy gameplay for sure.The older Monopoly game on the App Store, which I purchased long ago, was quite a bit better.

However, the game is hard to play on my own time. The game really only works when it wants to. Some are do to bugs, and some are due to just poor design. 1) Game will not load when you go offline still logged into Xbox. It will not let you sign out, and the game crashes repeatedly. I have not found a way to fix this, because even when I try to enable cellular data, it still will not load because no changes in settings are saved before the game crashes. This is extremely inconvenient when I just want to play single player offline. This bug has been going on for months and is consistently overlooked. Please fix this immediately. It discourages players from even attempting to load up their worlds, which ultimately hurts the developers.2) Background music stops when Minecraft is launched. If you are listening to Spotify/Pandora, etc, then the game automatically cuts off your music when you listen to the game. If people didn‚Äôt pause their music before entering the game, then obviously, they want to listen to it while the play!

I know this is good for internet safety etc etc but it‚Äôs really annoying. First of all the age limit should not be 18.

The menu is so bland, and it is so very clear that a lot more can be added to make it much more engaging and addictive. Personal daily challenges & achievements.

However, I bought this app so that I could play with my long distant friends, but we could never finish ANY game. The game has way too many bugs. It crashes and stop the game every time someone disconnect, which affects you and everyone else playing the same match. Getting disconnected is way too common, it happens when you get notification, when you click off the game for a split second, when you get a call, when you get a low battery warning, or poor wifi connection. The game can stop and crash at any point in the game. I wasted 2 hours playing a round just so it could crash mostly every single time. Out of the 35 games I‚Äôve played, I only got through 7 of them. Mind you, I had to pay for this app. It‚Äôs ridiculous. DONT BUY THIS APP unless they start making changes and improvements to it. Also they do not have any type of communication system so you can‚Äôt talk to your opponents. That should be included in the game to communicate with your opponents, negotiate for trades, or just to simply remind your opponents to end the game.

For some of the side challenges (e.g. knitting), the rewards, such as unlimited lives for a certain period of time, are given immediately. If I had the option to save that reward for a rainy day, perhaps when I‚Äôm tackling a particularly difficult level, I‚Äôd be more inclined to play for longer periods of time. When this happens, however, it‚Äôs almost always the case that I don‚Äôt have the time to actually use said reward and it ends up being useless. I‚Äôd also like to see the coin rewards have a better balance. 50-70 coins as a reward for each level won? Come on! What about an additional ten or so coins for each remaining turn? Say if I‚Äôve beaten a level and I have five turns left. I should win the base coins of fifty and then an additional fifty for each turn I didn‚Äôt use.

The second suggestion is offering more discounts on things like coins and prize boxes in the game. Maybe you could even call it Discount Day or Discount Week.

Like for example, having the game players find LIMITED EDITION Gold boxes along the trail, that are filled with SUPER RARE things like unlocking special characters or getting a BIG amount of gems or coins.

It‚Äôs a great game to play with friends and family, whether you want to create a massive structure or survive in the wilderness while fighting monsters, or do a bit of both. However, like every game, it does need some improvements. First of all, I suggest that it have a wider variety of animals in the game, (elephants, lions, tigers, sharks, etc). Also, I think their should be more options of furniture, especially in creative mode, rather than having to use steps as chairs. There are also a few glitches that can be annoying.

I‚Äôve been playing it since I was 8 years old, and it‚Äôs come a long way since then. Most games I play I usually play them for about a month or two, three at the most, and then forget about it. But Minecraft is different. It‚Äôs stuck with me for a long time now (almost 6 years). It‚Äôs a great game to play with friends and family, whether you want to create a massive structure or survive in the wilderness while fighting monsters, or do a bit of both. However, like every game, it does need some improvements. First of all, I suggest that it have a wider variety of animals in the game, (elephants, lions, tigers, sharks, etc). Also, I think their should be more options of furniture, especially in creative mode, rather than having to use steps as chairs. There are also a few glitches that can be annoying. For example, if you add to many mobs in creative, it will lag out your game. Also, there was this one time that I had to delete and reinstall the game because it wouldn‚Äôt let me open up the game. Regardless of some minor issues, this game is absolutely phenomenal and highly suggest downloading it! My advice to you is to first read the ‚Äúhow to‚Äù, it will tremendously help you get a head start on the game. Once you download this game, you won‚Äôt be able to stop playing!

There needs to be some sort of timer for everything so that way the game can keep moving or if someone doesn‚Äôt make any moves for a long period of time or purposely leaves the game they should go bankrupt and their properties should either get auctioned off or return back to the board for the other people to buy in the future. It‚Äôs super annoying having to leave a game because nobody is moving or being sore losers. I don‚Äôt have any interest in playing this game anymore because of this.

Now i‚Äôm not entirely sure if this a bug or a glitch so it might be nothing but it bothers me. So basically I play on the server: MineVille City. And when i go into one the minigames, that minigame being High-School Roleplay there are problems with my custom skin. So idk if this has to do with the server but this has happened most of the time. I walk around and when i pull up the pause menu my custom skin is replaced with a random skin. And I sometimes see other players with my skin equipped. And idk if my skin is working or not. Even when i do the inventory menu my custom skin is still there. So Mojang, if you see this then please reach out to me. My Minecraft account is a Xbox live account named Endermen21YT. So please if you can, look into this. Now this could totally just be the server or something else so this might not even be happening. I‚Äôve even noticed that this has happened to other ppl before on those servers. And it only happens when I enter the minigame. In the main server my skin‚Äôs fine. So anyway yeah that‚Äôs all.

I honestly think that it might take a month or almost a year to reach the amount because I‚Äôm not joking, they are really pricey. Unless you playing it nonstop without taking your eyes off the screen then it might take a few weeks. But that‚Äôs still a while. Also the hover boards. They can also get a little pricey. And why buy something that you can only use in certain times. It makes it worse that they can get really expensive. Honestly I think their pretty cool but please lower the prices. The last thing you might need to fix is the add lag. Sometimes it will start freezing up and you have to restart the app and that‚Äôs a little annoying in my opinion.

I might only use one more move to win and I just wasted 900 coins or it takes me 6 moves but to up the ante a second time costs another 1200 coins. How often do people use the 2100 coins for an extra 10 moves and if they do, did it take them another 5 moves to win or just 1? Let us dish out 100 coins at a time or buy more bombs or something.

But ever since Character Creator has been added to the game, my custom skins have been looking off. I use slim-armed skins because I prefer them over classic skins but the glitch only occurs on slim-armed skins. Let‚Äôs say you have a slim-armed skin, and you wanted a unique design on each leg. Like different-lengthened socks, or a flower on one and a star on the other. Then when you upload the skin on the game, whatever way you designed the right leg (it looks like the left leg if you look straight at the skin) gets copy and pasted automatically onto the left leg (right leg if you look at the skin straight at the face). It looks distorted, as I don‚Äôt know if other players can or cannot see the error besides yourself, but it‚Äôs basically both legs are symmetrical while a lot of skin designers like not making symmetrical, and the second layer on the leg that gets changed to looking like the other stays. So basically the glitched leg looks exactly like the other leg that looks perfectly fine, but has second layer on it. Like then both legs would have like a flower on it but the star‚Äôs second layer is stuck on top of the copy and pasted flower. Pretty odd right?

However, it is far too common for a player to get disconnected or for the game to freeze, ultimately ruining the entire game and leading me to have wasted 2 hours of my time. Also, it is hard to differentiate when a player is simply not paying attention, forgets to roll, or forgets to end their turn so it would be EXTREMELY USEFUL to have a ******chat function****** or at least a button the players could use to notify other players when the game has come to a standstill. I really hope that the monopoly app creators will take these suggestions into account as I have recommended the app to many people and know they have experienced the same frustration as me. Also, it would be awesome if their was a way to pause the game (which I know may actually difficult due to connection issues). Additionally, the game disconnects when someone gets a phone call or even if low battery signal pops up on a players phone. Sometimes the bots will pick up and play for the disconnected user but other times the game is screwed. Regardless, I love how the game is customizable and has great layouts.

This is extremely inconvenient when I just want to play single player offline. This bug has been going on for months and is consistently overlooked. Please fix this immediately. It discourages players from even attempting to load up their worlds, which ultimately hurts the developers.2) Background music stops when Minecraft is launched. If you are listening to Spotify/Pandora, etc, then the game automatically cuts off your music when you listen to the game. If people didn‚Äôt pause their music before entering the game, then obviously, they want to listen to it while the play!

For example, every task around the house goes from costing one star to two. The rewards aren‚Äôt sufficient to the amount of boosts being spent on harder levels. Some levels are so hard and waste so many lives that you have to use boosts just to get through it. There should be more levels that don‚Äôt take multiple tries to get through. Some of the tasks that the game makes you do are stupid. The game is trying to get you to use all your stars so you have to play more, which is typical, but with the levels so hard, it‚Äôs really just a tactic to get people to spend more money. It‚Äôs also takes way too long for the lives to reload. It‚Äôs like 25mins per life. I really liked this game at the start but the further I‚Äôve gotten, the less I want to continue playing. Instead of throwing in so many different aspects into the puzzle games so soon, they should have waited and made it harder much later. I‚Äôm only in the kitchen and I spend on average 3-5 lives on each level. I try not to use boosters because they are so hard to earn. Paying 900coins to get 5 more moves on one level, when each level earns you roughly 50-70 coins (hard levels earn you 100+) is just sad. In conclusion, this game only remains fun for the first 60 levels then gets frustrating.

It is very entertaining any enjoyable to collect new characters, hover boards, daily challenge items, etc. I can‚Äôt stop playing it!

It is very entertaining and sometimes I spend hours in a day playing it. The levels seem to get really difficult after you start renovating the third room. I really find it so frustrating that we have to wait 30 minutes for each life to come back. Also, the amount of moves given in each level is ridiculous. Sometimes, you need just 2 more moves to pass the level and you can‚Äôt because you‚Äôre out of moves. Then, if you want more, you have to pay 900 coins for only five more moves. And if you don‚Äôt have the money, you have to forfeit and loose the game. Other times, you can join competitions and get really cool power ups. If I get stuck on one of the levels in the challenges, I loose all my prizes and earned money. The point of the game is to be fun and decorate a house, which honestly is my favorite part of the game. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the matching part of the game is so fun too, I just hate the fact that you have to wait so long to get lives and some of the tasks they ask you to do are just ridiculous.

I‚Äôve been playing since I was like 5, and the game has never failed to produce quality entertainment. But this, it was just sad to say the least.             It lags, the graphics are childish, and the whole update was a mess. When changing from the character section to the board section I now have to wait for it to load, that didn‚Äôt use to happen. The graphics now seem like a downgrade compared to what it used to be, how do you even do that? Seriously, the game used to be good enough to be played by all ages, but now it seems like only 6 year olds can enjoy the design. Another thing, this may have been a glitch or something, but where did my coins go? I had like 700,000+ coins, but after the update I was down to about 100,000. Not cool. Not cool at all.             I know that you wanted to switch things up, and while I may not like it, it is your game. Hopefully in later updates you will fix things and learn from this experience. Until then, this game will stay deleted. Thanks for the game, at least while it was good. üòî",This update is not it honey.,3,True,general,negative,5

I thought I was making the mistakes but nope every game it happens SEVERAL times. Roll a five & it will go 6 to land you on someone‚Äôs hotel...incredibly frustrating.  The game is also very predictable. If you build properties the next roll the next player almost every time won't land on you. I like the game, however another issue is that it freezes up at crucial junctures of the game. Such as after a trade. You have no choice after several minutes to abandon the game. Very frustrating after vesting so much time into it. Also I just finished a game & I bankrupted every player then it announced the last bankrupted player as the ‚Äúwinner!‚Äù. Ticks you off especially after spending an hour with idiots that want to make the same trade every single turn! I almost quit several times but I hung in there and put up with it because the other normal player suffering through the BS like I was. The game definitely needs some improvements. I would give this 3-1/2 stars but it won‚Äôt let me. PLEASE FIX THE FREEZE UP PROBLEM! CONSTANT CONNECTION PROBLEMS TOO! I check my internet & it‚Äôs connected. And all my other devices are working.",I would give this 3-1/2 stars but it won‚Äôt let me.,2,True,general,negative,5

But I have suggestions, can you add a friending thing? Like where you can friend people so u to it can play with them again. Like if you know the person in real life or if you liked playing with them! I also really think you should at least have one pet for free, the mini Crewmate is like and icon for the game, but then you download it and found out you have to pay to get it. Thanks you reading this and I would recommend this game for anyone, even if these suggestions don‚Äôt happen!After Update:The update is, well, weird. The cameras on Polus have glitches all over them so when some walks on camera there is a million copies of them and on some areas, two different camera sections collide and look very weird. The chat, I like that you have the quick chat, but I really don‚Äôt like that we still can‚Äôt just type. It‚Äôs so hard to find what you want to say and by the time you find it, everyone has already voted. Also on the Polus map, the names do disappear, but I kinda like it because you can hide. Another thing on the Polus map, the lava is gone, I see the bubbles still but the actual lava is not there. One last thing, when I am a ghost, I sometimes like to go outside of the map, but I noticed that now there is no wall keeping me from going away too far, can you please bring that wall back? Thanks!",It is so addicting!,5,True,enjoyability,positive,4

I'd love to see more effort in existing packs, and a broader variety of deck selections. Seriously make ""the office"" deck. There are tons more great tv shows to play this game with. If you won't pick up more tv shows, you should sell a blank editable deck that we could write our own answers on and play with our own categories.

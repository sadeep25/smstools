Not that they‚Äôre not working extra hard to make you do it... When I started playing, it was fun because I always had a chance to win. The kite will do what it‚Äôs supposed to and the bombs won‚Äôt go and destroy the next move. The rocket with a kite won‚Äôt go and clear the row with already a rocket in it, thus ruining 2 rockets. Decorating wasn‚Äôt as hard either. You didn‚Äôt need a star to make every call and 2 stars for a rehearsal. Around level 900 it started getting frustrating and I stopped for a while. A few months ago I started playing and nothing is the same. The power ups are there to ruin your game. One has to depend on luck than tact to win. It‚Äôs now designed to eat all your hammers, kites, gloves etc but still won‚Äôt let you win. If I was frustrated before, I‚Äôm finding it hard to express myself now. Ofcourse the proportion of coins you win to the stars you earn was always unfair but atleast I knew that in every game there would be some move and a definite chance to win. They want you to buy coins, I get it, they are after all here for the money. But looks like they‚Äôre taking away the fun factor away from the game which for me has been the biggest disappointment. This was a good game, very addictive and fun. It‚Äôs getting hard to say that that is true anymore.",The power ups are there to ruin your game.,2,True,efficiency,negative,3

The levels are so hard and the payout is so low. I‚Äôm deleted the game today because I don‚Äôt spend ‚Äúreal‚Äù money on games, especially when there isn‚Äôt a good return. The amount of coins that are needed to buy things like boosters and lives are crazy high. 900 coins for 5more moves on a level is crazy and then if you want to do it again, it‚Äôs 1200! When you only win between 50 and 100 coins ( on a really good round) it takes a really long time to recoup. They are very stingy with giving you boosters and chances to get more coins. I play other games that are very generous with coins and boosters which allows me to play and enjoy the game. Isn‚Äôt that what the game should be all about? Challenging levels are one thing, but when it takes so many lives to win a level it‚Äôs not fun anymore. I won 2 hours, played constantly for that time and only made it through 2 levels. Also, when you win 2or 3 hours of free play, it should be put away so I can play when I want to. If I win 3lives on the wheel, it gets put away...I should be able to play an hour at a time when I want to play....I worked hard to win those hours and I should be able to play them. Love the game, but it‚Äôs too bad that the developers are really greedy and don‚Äôt want us to enjoy their games.","I‚Äôm deleted the game today because I don‚Äôt spend ‚Äúreal‚Äù money on games, especially when there isn‚Äôt a good return.",3,True,cost,negative,1

This has happened to me twice before, and each time I had multiple very accomplished worlds. What happens is that one second, it‚Äôs working just fine, and then when you try to get on it next time, you can‚Äôt even make it to the loading screen without it crashing. When this happens, it keeps happening, and you can‚Äôt get onto your Minecraft, not even onto your home screen, so you can try to find out what is wrong. Every time this happens to me, it is completely hopeless, and I end up deleting Minecraft. Then, when I redownload it, I lose all of my worlds, skins, servers, and everything except your Xbox live account, which you have to log back into. It is the most annoying thing ever, and I hate it so much. The reason I am actually writing this review is because I am hoping someone at Mojang will see it, and try to troubleshoot the problem. Also, when I tried to look up my problem on Minecraft forums, it looked like a bunch of other people have had the exact same problem, and it‚Äôs not getting fixed. If this problem doesn‚Äôt get fixed, I‚Äôm deleting Minecraft altogether because it was a complete waste of my money.  I really hope this problem can get solved, because I really enjoy playing Minecraft, and I don‚Äôt want to loose all of my progress.

If so I would recommend picking up your phone and download Subway Surfers. I love to just sit back and run on the train tracks for hours. What I love about this game is how they make it have a really cool theme. The characters are all so cool and at the start You are spray painting and the police come running after you. Sometimes I feel like I am in the game itself. I like how they give you head starters and the font and if you die they sometime let you come back alive after just watching a video. The only down side about the game is he hover boards and the characters are all SO MANY coins and keys. I am never able to get that many coins and keys. I just try to get enough coins to get the character Lucy, and her scary outfit or whatever it is called. Then I just play the game and like a month later I will try to see how much I can pay for. I also hate how all you do in the game is run on train tracks with a few of the same obstacles in your way. I just sometimes wish there could be more obstacles or Like different courses you take.

I remember surprise Friday or Friday surprise, but then it stopped. Until an exception- Surprise Saturday. Ah yes. I remember why polar bears were added in the game, and the reason. Jeb‚Äôs wife (I think it‚Äôs Jeb‚Äôs..) liked polar bears, so that‚Äôs why they were added. The original Mobil lite version, and I remember when Minecraft PE was free. All this time it‚Äôs been downloaded in my cloud storage, so I never had to buy it. (Heh) This game never stops improving. But of course, I‚Äôm more of a Java version myself, of course. The days of me and the boys, staying up all night, gaming, building whatever we could. I also remember the day when Microsoft bought Mojang, or did they buy Minecraft? Anyways. The first minecon was about 30 people, mostly Notches‚Äô family. The good ol days of Minecraft. A few things could be changed though.

I don‚Äôt doubt that a lot of people would like to respond to this comment by saying you just have to play for a bit longer but my point is I shouldn‚Äôt have to play for longer to try to finally experience the game and have fun with it, I shouldn‚Äôt have to constantly search for public games until eventually i come across someone who‚Äôs actually going to be nice, or actually be able to join a public game because for some reason this game decides to list games that are hosted by players but the game is already going so I‚Äôm not allowed to join.

This app is amazing, along with its beautiful, tear-bringing soundtrack. As I look back on the app, it has changed so much. It sounds crazy, but I almost wish it was back to the days when you lived off of cows and used boats, but now it‚Äôs all cheats and crazy builds and bees. But my favorite part has to be the soundtrack. Listening to these songs, all the memories flow in and rush back, and I think about my brother and cousin building a mansion, and me begging to play, or when my brother would still play with me. This game was my childhood. And while everyone else is crooning over Fortnite, Minecraft remains the best. The music is just magnificent. But, there are a few things that need fixing. Whenever I get on, it says there was an account error, and I don‚Äôt even have an account. Also, I made a few characters and they fail to load. Finally, I just wish on Pocket Edition you could go back to different updates so I could play like I used to; no bees, no dolphins, no crazy stuff - just how the game started out. For me, listening to the soundtrack and the scent of Winter Candy Apple by Bath and Body Works brings back all the memories. Minecraft will always be with us.

I can fairly say that it is a well-executed game with consistent updates and support. I like the creative side as well as the puzzle side it‚Äôs a nice balance. One thing everyone should know unequivocally before beginning, however, is that the developers hate the players. Hate may not even be a strong enough word for it. I could be wrong, maybe it‚Äôs impossible to fairly balance a puzzle game but to program it so much in the favor of you losing is... unsurprising considering how often it wants you to purchase things. Now, you don‚Äôt have ads in this game, which is nice, and the options to purchase don‚Äôt ensure victory (I mean at all), so in a sense the game is consistent and there‚Äôs some comfort in that. The reward system is pretty rough, it does sometimes feel like an endless attempt to wear you down. You will rage quit from time to time, or put it down for a couple months, but this is a casual game. Whereas other games make me feel as if they‚Äôve earned my business, I find the challenge of this one is seeing how far I can go without spending any money, because it tries so hard. It‚Äôs my tiny moral victory. But hey, great time waster so if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre going for, you‚Äôll likely stay engaged and distracted from your reality and isn‚Äôt that what we all want anyways?","The reward system is pretty rough, it does sometimes feel like an endless attempt to wear you down.",3,True,enjoyability,positive,4

Board games in reality are fixed in many ways. For example, a deck of cards with a discard pile ensured that every card in the game will be played before a player can draw a second copy of any card. This also ensures equal odds of getting a card. This app takes the simpler approach of randomly generating the card on each draw. This means you may draw cards like ‚ÄúSpeeding Fine‚Äù two or three times in a row, while never pulling ‚ÄúAdvance To...‚Äù cards of any kind. The odds of card drawing seem to also favor the weaker cards. The developers assure that‚Äôs not true, but an easy way to restore faith would be to have the cards work with an actual deck and discard system instead of random generation upon each draw. To me, the purpose of this is to mimic the board game, if you wanted to change the fundamentals of the game then a different game mode would be nice. A ‚ÄúRandomized‚Äù mode could be fun along with the original two, but I would want the ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù mode to run like the classic board game. Otherwise, the game is functionally okay. Some cards do not work as intended, like cards that require paying between players, but most major bugs have been worked out. TL/DRThe old app was much better","Otherwise, the game is functionally okay.",2,True,general,positive,5

I LOVE this game, considering how hard it is to find a murder mystery game that is fun, challenging, and overall a enjoyable game. And I gotta say, this game nails the classic murder mystery game vibe. Considering how easy it is to pick up and go, you can really play it whenever you want, which is awesome in on itself, but it only makes it even better is how it‚Äôs free on mobile, is so nice, and it‚Äôs one of the main reasons it got popular in the first place, almost anyone with a phone could get the game! Sure, the advertisements can be a bit annoying, but that is really a small hiccup in the game, and besides, a free game has to have some kind of advertisements to keep it alive, so it‚Äôs hardly even a problem. The only real issue I had with this game was connection issues, but again, the game overall kinda shadows out the issues. The tasks/mini games are probably one of the best parts about this game, each one feels fun to do, especially if you can get a rhythm for each task. And the fact that you can have small meetings to decide who they think the murderer/imposter is, is GENIUS. This makes the game run at a good pace, makes replay ability amazing, and overall a amazing game. So innersloth, I‚Äôm excited for the updates and ideas you have for this game in the future!

For example, every task around the house goes from costing one star to two. The rewards aren‚Äôt sufficient to the amount of boosts being spent on harder levels. Some levels are so hard and waste so many lives that you have to use boosts just to get through it. There should be more levels that don‚Äôt take multiple tries to get through. Some of the tasks that the game makes you do are stupid. The game is trying to get you to use all your stars so you have to play more, which is typical, but with the levels so hard, it‚Äôs really just a tactic to get people to spend more money. It‚Äôs also takes way too long for the lives to reload. It‚Äôs like 25mins per life. I really liked this game at the start but the further I‚Äôve gotten, the less I want to continue playing. Instead of throwing in so many different aspects into the puzzle games so soon, they should have waited and made it harder much later. I‚Äôm only in the kitchen and I spend on average 3-5 lives on each level. I try not to use boosters because they are so hard to earn. Paying 900coins to get 5 more moves on one level, when each level earns you roughly 50-70 coins (hard levels earn you 100+) is just sad.

Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!!

I am not exaggerating, I have heard the N word, the F word, and so many other ridiculously bad and racist words in this game than I did in the real world.

For those of you who don‚Äôt have the game what I mean is that people under 18 have to use the quick chat feature instead of saying whatever. But if you‚Äôre over 18 you can use free chat and say whatever you want. I feel that the age limit should be 13 or 14 instead of 18. Like, the majority of this game‚Äôs players are under 18 and I don‚Äôt think that people over 13 really need that level of ‚Äúinternet safety‚Äù protection. Second of all with this new quick chat it takes away some of the things that you want to say about who the imposter is and why you are suspicious of them and whatnot. Some things are so unique you just need to put them in your own words. For example the other day I was playing and I saw Orange running away from a dead body. I reported the body but there was no option to say ‚Äú(A) was running away from the body.‚Äù Some things are so unlikely or one-time happenings that they don‚Äôt have options to say it, but when it does happen you can‚Äôt do anything about it. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt like this new update and wish that Among Us would go back to the way it was before.",Some things are so unique you just need to put them in your own words.,4,True,effectiveness,positive,2

All my peers were chattering about a seemingly endless canvas, a world so filled with animals and landmarks, yet so empty to the creative mind. A world to be filled with whatever you wish, all in your pocket. To this day, I still believe this is the best purchase I have ever made in my lifetime. Any boring, gloomy day was instantly changed upon starting up this masterpiece of an app. Any player regardless of age has the opportunity to escape to a place where your imagination can flow endlessly. A place to escape the sometimes harsh realities of the real world. I am now a teen in highschool, awaiting my days until graduation as well as my days until adult life. I recently started up the app after years of inactivity due to the minuscule amount of time available for leisure nowadays, especially for the average highschool student. I noticed the changes made to the game. And then when sunset arrived, memories came flooding back. The memories of summer nights spent with friends in this little world that taught us so much. A game that taught us to never put a boundary to our imagination. As I reminisced, I realized how much the game has shaped me as a person. As friends, days, months, and years went in and out of my life, this game has always remained by my side. A lifelong friend. Thank you mojang.

However I did find more cons than pros. Let‚Äôs start off with finding a server. You have three different maps to choose from. You can also choose if you want to play with 1, 2, or 3 imposters. The imposter‚Äôs job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with ‚ÄúConfirm Ejects‚Äù and ‚ÄúVisual Tasks‚Äù on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says ‚Äú(insert anything here) was not An Imposter‚Äù or ‚Äúwas An Imposter‚Äù. With it being the imposter‚Äôs job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! This game is ruled by immature 12 year olds and when they get accused, they break lose. I am not exaggerating, I have heard the N word, the F word, and so many other ridiculously bad and racist words in this game than I did in the real world. The N word is a word that you will encounter. People think it‚Äôs okay if they leave the hard r out but it‚Äôs not. The N word is probably the most popular word in this game. I could go on and on but these are the main reasons why I gave it one star",However almost everyone play with ‚ÄúConfirm Ejects‚Äù and ‚ÄúVisual Tasks‚Äù on.,1,True,general,negative,5

I Also think this game should have a save game feature because if you are in a game and you have a HUGE score, and your device shuts down by accident, or even just turns off you lose all your progress!! To add on to that point, they should have some sort of button to press when you have to go and you are in the middle of a run, so when you have to go, you press the button and it saves the run so you can go back into the game another time. I also think that this games characters are a little over priced.  But that‚Äôs all I have to say on the negative side of things. But on the positive side, this game is an amazing pass time if you want to spend some mindless time in quarantine. It is also overall just really fun.

And if you‚Äôre under 13 or whatever age it is, it won‚Äôt even let you chose your own name! What‚Äôs up with that? However it did have the new map. But with the new update I can only use the quick chat thingy which stinks. Anyway, I tried joining a game and when the game was about to tell if I‚Äôm crewmate or imposter or whatever the screen goes black and nothing happens. So I close out of the app and delete the app. When I re-downloaded it it didn‚Äôt let me chose my age again, so I was stuck with the non-custom name and the quick chat.

When joining a game on WiFi it will keep saying unable to connect. And it is too hard to kick people from games especially when everyone has to vote for them to leave. Teaming is a HUGE issue in the game with entire groups of friends outing the imposters as soon as the game starts. The emergency button is used too often... or often use it to SAY HI!!! I find it frustrating when trying to play the game. PLEASE ADD A VOICE CHAT OPTION!!! This would make the game so much easier and I feel that it would defer toxic language because you can hear a person‚Äôs voice.

And once you‚Äôre out of stars, you can‚Äôt do anything else until you have won more candy crush games and earned more stars. You earn one star from winning each candy crush game no matter how difficult the game is. Win in one round, earn one star. Win after 20 rounds, earn one star.

I know there‚Äôs probably no fixing that but it kinda gets annoying being for them to be like that. Also, I think you should make like a friend thing where like you can befriend people in the game and they can send you ( or you send them) friend request and when either of you accept then you can chat with them and join the same game as them so you don‚Äôt have to go through like hundreds of other servers to see them again.

The animation is also way too long and it‚Äôs been frustratingly improbable trying to play with others online. And the fact that the game is server-sided does not change the developers‚Äô minds to at least rent a competent server, because from what I‚Äôve witnessed throughout the last few months, the servers have been utter trash.

I just try to get enough coins to get the character Lucy, and her scary outfit or whatever it is called. Then I just play the game and like a month later I will try to see how much I can pay for.

I personally was over the top crazy for it and loved it, but it‚Äôs now dead for many reasons. One reason is hackers and cheaters. More mods are being used and hacking and cheating is getting more popular. Some times, I can‚Äôt play one game without a hacker or cheater. Multiple people play together and say who is the imposter and some hackers are being able to kill in the middle of meetings and do visuals as imposter. Another reason is that there are no new maps. Among us said that the new airship would come out in early December 2020, but they delayed it and said early 2021. Everyone thought it would come out in January or February, but it‚Äôs March and it still hasn‚Äôt come out yet. Another reason is that the new chat update can‚Äôt let you talk freely. Now you spend all of  your meeting time searching around for the prewritten text that you want to say. Another reason is the horrible connection. Some times, I have to spend like 20 minutes trying to connect my game. People say it‚Äôs my bad wifi, but that‚Äôs not true because my wifi works perfectly fine.

If you decide to just stick with private mode then you will be absolutely fine. You can have a fun time with some friends and overall enjoy this game. But then I tried public games.It wasn‚Äôt as bad as you think it would be. I ran into a total of one weirdo and was totally fine. I had no problems. The only time something really weird happened was when somebody with a weird name had tried to get us to follow his/her Twitter, but thanks to the new update Among Us blocks your ability to redirect to another website in the chat. Here‚Äôs the thing though. Recently, I ran into another one of the weird-named people, and they said in the chat that the lobby was hacked and he/she had all of the players‚Äô IP addresses. This was an empty threat, as IP addresses are public knowledge (and you can‚Äôt find out where you are based on them)and Apple phones are virtually impossible to hack. However, this really shook me up and I deleted Among Us immediately. I didn‚Äôt want to be hacked. EVER. It was kind of scary even though I knew the extensive anti-hacking measures taken place by InnerSloth (the game‚Äôs creator). While this game is fun, it‚Äôs not worth it being scared every time my friends aren‚Äôt up for a game. If you are getting this for a group of friends/family, then you are fine.

The reward to effort is completely unfair. The base reward is 50 coins while the cost for boosts, extended moves, or just about anything is 900 coins or more. Coins are sold in the shop for .99 cents per 900 which is crazy expensive considering 900 coins will on get 5 additional moves or 3 destroy balls (not sure what they are actually called). If 5 mores moves is not enough to complete the level the next 5 cost 1200 coins. The puzzles are designed to require boosts or additional moves. Each puzzle won rewards a star. Stars are required to perform actions for upgrading the garden or home. Though it is satisfying to watch the transformations and improvements I get frustrated when required to spend a star to greet someone at the door to receive a package, then another star to open the package. All the extra actions not related to actual upgrades seems like a complete waste of stars considering the difficulty of obtaining them.  One good thing added to the game is the option to watch commercials to receive coins.

I recently started up the app after years of inactivity due to the minuscule amount of time available for leisure nowadays, especially for the average highschool student. I noticed the changes made to the game. And then when sunset arrived, memories came flooding back. The memories of summer nights spent with friends in this little world that taught us so much. A game that taught us to never put a boundary to our imagination. As I reminisced, I realized how much the game has shaped me as a person.

When you get a mystery box it can give you items that help you unlock characters. I honestly think that it might take a month or almost a year to reach the amount because I‚Äôm not joking, they are really pricey. Unless you playing it nonstop without taking your eyes off the screen then it might take a few weeks. But that‚Äôs still a while. Also the hover boards. They can also get a little pricey. And why buy something that you can only use in certain times. It makes it worse that they can get really expensive. Honestly I think their pretty cool but please lower the prices. The last thing you might need to fix is the add lag. Sometimes it will start freezing up and you have to restart the app and that‚Äôs a little annoying in my opinion.

My ONLY complaint, if you play against the AI don‚Äôt expect to win. I‚Äôve won once because AI don‚Äôt get lucky and this is on EASY AI. You can have an entire side of the board and they will almost always land on a spot that is either safe or really low value. If you own the blue and brown by GO for example, they will often times go to JAIL therefore delaying coming close to those properties. Anytime they land on a CHANCE or COMMUNITY CHEST, they almost always get positive cards. They continuously try to trade you if they need a card so that can be tweaked.

I‚Äôd like to be able to use 100 coins for each move I want to add. I might only use one more move to win and I just wasted 900 coins or it takes me 6 moves but to up the ante a second time costs another 1200 coins. How often do people use the 2100 coins for an extra 10 moves and if they do, did it take them another 5 moves to win or just 1? Let us dish out 100 coins at a time or buy more bombs or something.

For a relatively simple game, it creates surprising amounts of tension, and with the right group of players, the experience can be a total blast. So, why the mediocre rating? Innersloth recently released what I can only describe as a ruinous, game-breaking update. Firstly, disconnections are frequent; in a game whose structure relies upon every player living long enough to cast out the killer(s) before meeting either win/loss condition, losing those players to disconnection means one less pair of hands for tasks, one less vote per meeting, one less identity to hide among, or one less partner to kill crewmates. If it were just one, a person could grouse and learn to get over it. But it is many. The problem is large enough to merit redress. And there are game-ending graphical errors, too. From time to time, avatars glitch through/into walls, or walk into out-of-bounds areas. I even lost a game once where I thought I broke another player‚Äôs alibi because she claimed to be someplace, but she was plainly visible right next to me. Turns out she wasn‚Äôt a liar‚Äîmy game was just glitchy. Post-game glitches often mean rebooting and losing your lobby, which is the end of the world, but can be really demoralizing when you finally find a cool group to play with.

It‚Äôs pretty bad when you start a match with no moves and it has to reshuffle. Power ups can be hit or miss at the start. Towards the higher levels you‚Äôll start off with a very small section and you‚Äôll have to open the rest of the field but you‚Äôll end up wasting 3 or 4 moves before you can even do that. Some levels seem impossible to beat without the RNG gods giving you tons of power ups. You‚Äôll often lose by 1 move which prompts you to use coins to buy 5 more moves. If you don‚Äôt have the coins, that‚Äôs when they hit you with the pay to win aspect of it. As many other people have said, it often feels like the game is working against you maliciously so you‚Äôll be forced to buy more coins or power ups. It gets extremely frustrating playing the same level thirty times and losing by 1 move over and over. This is the same for both gardenscapes and homescapes (and probably the other games by the same developers). Bottom lines is you can pretty much tell by mid match if you‚Äôre going to beat the level or not. If you still have 75% of the objectives to complete and you‚Äôve been forced to waste 3 or 4 moves in a row and you have less than 10 moves left, you‚Äôre not gonna win.

Now i‚Äôm not entirely sure if this a bug or a glitch so it might be nothing but it bothers me. So basically I play on the server: MineVille City. And when i go into one the minigames, that minigame being High-School Roleplay there are problems with my custom skin. So idk if this has to do with the server but this has happened most of the time. I walk around and when i pull up the pause menu my custom skin is replaced with a random skin. And I sometimes see other players with my skin equipped. And idk if my skin is working or not. Even when i do the inventory menu my custom skin is still there. So Mojang, if you see this then please reach out to me. My Minecraft account is a Xbox live account named Endermen21YT. So please if you can, look into this. Now this could totally just be the server or something else so this might not even be happening. I‚Äôve even noticed that this has happened to other ppl before on those servers. And it only happens when I enter the minigame. In the main server my skin‚Äôs fine. So anyway yeah that‚Äôs all.

Subway Surfers by Killow is just the app to get.  To start with I like all the powerups.  A powerup is a thing that you can get that can help you get more coins.  I like the jetpack powerup because it gives you lots of coins without the police officer chasing you.  I also like the magnet power up because you can get all the coins for a couple seconds without crashing. I also like how you can get keys.  Keys are things that are hard to get but you can get a lot of stuff with them like outfits and hoverboards.  For example, you can get characters with them.  I also like how you can get keys by doing stuff like getting 810 coins in one run you can get 8 keys.  Last of all, I like how you can watch videos to get things.  For example, you can watch a video every day to get two keys and you can also get super mystery boxes by watching videos too.  Last, I like  if you are at 0 coins or 0 keys, you can watch videos nonstop and get 10 keys in 15 minutes or get 10,000 coins in 20 minutes.  As you can see this is a very good game.

I could be wrong, maybe it‚Äôs impossible to fairly balance a puzzle game but to program it so much in the favor of you losing is... unsurprising considering how often it wants you to purchase things. Now, you don‚Äôt have ads in this game, which is nice, and the options to purchase don‚Äôt ensure victory (I mean at all), so in a sense the game is consistent and there‚Äôs some comfort in that. The reward system is pretty rough, it does sometimes feel like an endless attempt to wear you down. You will rage quit from time to time, or put it down for a couple months, but this is a casual game.

For a relatively simple game, it creates surprising amounts of tension, and with the right group of players, the experience can be a total blast. So, why the mediocre rating? Innersloth recently released what I can only describe as a ruinous, game-breaking update. Firstly, disconnections are frequent; in a game whose structure relies upon every player living long enough to cast out the killer(s) before meeting either win/loss condition, losing those players to disconnection means one less pair of hands for tasks, one less vote per meeting, one less identity to hide among, or one less partner to kill crewmates. If it were just one, a person could grouse and learn to get over it. But it is many. The problem is large enough to merit redress. And there are game-ending graphical errors, too. From time to time, avatars glitch through/into walls, or walk into out-of-bounds areas. I even lost a game once where I thought I broke another player‚Äôs alibi because she claimed to be someplace, but she was plainly visible right next to me. Turns out she wasn‚Äôt a liar‚Äîmy game was just glitchy. Post-game glitches often mean rebooting and losing your lobby, which is the end of the world, but can be really demoralizing when you finally find a cool group to play with. To sum: I‚Äôm really glad Among Us is enjoying its popularity, I just wish they‚Äôd fix it.","Innersloth recently released what I can only describe as a ruinous, game-breaking update.",3,True,general,positive,5

It is a great game to play with friends and just play in your free time. I love being the imposter and being a crewmate is just as fun. Though, so people have been hacking the game and choosing who the imposter is, walking outside the ship, and sabotaging when they are even not a crewmate. (By the way, crewmates cannot sabotage.) It makes the game a little less fun, but it is still great. Though, recently, they updated it so that in the chat, you cannot say things that you want to say and instead you can only say stuff like ‚ÄúBlah is the imposter!‚Äù or ‚ÄúBlah vented!‚Äù (The imposter can go though vents to travel faster.) It is WAY more confusing than the older version and it makes it a little less enjoyable. When I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to operate the chat to say something, people assumed I was the imposter and voted me out. (You can vote people out if people vote them out.) I know that they did this so that it can be safer so that people don‚Äôt say bad words, but it is difficult. Also, I know that the people who made among us cannot change this, but could you at least put ‚ÄúI am having trouble using the chat,‚Äù or something like that?

The amount of coins that are needed to buy things like boosters and lives are crazy high. 900 coins for 5more moves on a level is crazy and then if you want to do it again, it‚Äôs 1200! When you only win between 50 and 100 coins ( on a really good round) it takes a really long time to recoup. They are very stingy with giving you boosters and chances to get more coins. I play other games that are very generous with coins and boosters which allows me to play and enjoy the game. Isn‚Äôt that what the game should be all about? Challenging levels are one thing, but when it takes so many lives to win a level it‚Äôs not fun anymore. I won 2 hours, played constantly for that time and only made it through 2 levels.

But, it is good that the hard and extra hard are few and far between, so it‚Äôs not overwhelming, it‚Äôs a good change of pace. And, as others have said, rewards are few and far between as well.  Especially with the hard levels, the rewards are just this: your normal level low coin reward is doubled and you are rewarded with one extra star.

There is a reason we play games that say that they are free, it‚Äôs because a lot of us do not have the funds to use actual money to progress farther in the game faster then the other players that can afford to use their hard earned money.  In conclusion, I think this game is well worth 5 stars, however, I did only give it 4 stars on account of the hard and very hard levels & the lack of well deserved rewards.

To break it down for you: I‚Äôm at level 122 (which is impossible to beat without a booster because of how it is set up), which is about midway through the 5th decoration level in the game (haven‚Äôt even broached the upstairs level yet). I‚Äôve already spent $60 on coins/boosters, & I‚Äôve only been playing 2 weeks. Not going to spend anymore $ on this (even though I enjoy it) simply on principle.

Give bonus random coins for no reason or a closing jackpot at the end of each game or Room.  To spend and spend and never win anything back except 50 coins to 100 coins is disheartening.

I spent a little thinking it was just a hard level I needed to get by, but then every level after that has been just as hard. I play a lot of these match 3 games, and have done VERY well in them without having to spend a ton of money, it's just not fair to give a player 25 moves to accomplish 3 different things in one level! I want to keep playing because I like the concept and I like decorating the house, but I cannot keep spending money to beat levels, I've barely now made it to the kitchen and have probably spent $60 on this stupid game. And I see many many others have complained of the same thing. Wish I read reviews before I installed and got hooked.

I realize that it breaks up the monotony, but, I spend days sometimes trying to beat the level.  But, it is good that the hard and extra hard are few and far between, so it‚Äôs not overwhelming, it‚Äôs a good change of pace. And, as others have said, rewards are few and far between as well.  Especially with the hard levels, the rewards are just this: your normal level low coin reward is doubled and you are rewarded with one extra star.  I know you have to make money in this venture, but, your doing it to the detriment of your customers.  There is a reason we play games that say that they are free, it‚Äôs because a lot of us do not have the funds to use actual money to progress farther in the game faster then the other players that can afford to use their hard earned money.  In conclusion, I think this game is well worth 5 stars, however, I did only give it 4 stars on account of the hard and very hard levels & the lack of well deserved rewards.

Luckily other people within the server stepped in and we told the kid not to share that information but there really needs to be a system in place. There have also been times of people bullying other people. This is also not okay and just another reason there needs to be a way to report people for misconduct.

There are a lot of people that play Among Us who are not very smart and accuse people for no reason and everybody listens without any evidence.

So, first off I would like to start this review off with talking about how much I love this game. I downloaded this game years ago and still love it. It‚Äôs ultimately a great game. Here‚Äôs some of my requests you should do. First off, could you guys please make the game where you don‚Äôt need wifi to be able to join people? It always makes road trips boring for me if I want to play minecraft with a friend. Also, if you guys could make it where people can share a wolf. My first wolf from the beginning passed away tonight due to a skeleton attack. Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone‚Äôs been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful. Also if you could make it where villagers, foxes, and mobs can be leashed. That‚Äôs all my requests for now. Thank you!",Considering we are his aunts.,5,True,general,positive,5

Why it‚Äôs A annoying. This update makes it hard to type and this so called safe environment is dum. If a player feels like they are getting attacked then they just leave the game and join a new one. If this does not work then they can play with friends or uninstall the game. Another thing is that it feels like you ‚Äú the among us savers ‚Äú are taking away freedom of speech. How?    If someone can‚Äôt say what they want to say about this or that it feels like you censored who that person,thing,or whatever is. However you might say this ‚Äúwell we also have it we‚Äôre if your 18 plus (example for age) you can say what you want to say ‚Äú and your right but but but most people that play this game are under 18 plus as of myself. So these people who have to deal with this new way of ‚Äúspeech‚Äù would most likely not like this but then again I‚Äôm not them. If you feel like I‚Äôm wrong then I‚Äôm wrong if you feel like I‚Äôm right then I‚Äôm right but I‚Äôm just shooting out there that this ‚Äúupdate‚Äù might or should I say will effect this games success in a good way or bad way and if it does effect it in a bad way then at least you would know why.

If you want to get something, or double up something, you can just watch a a short add. There are also Pop Up adds which are much better than killing videos between each game.

There is so much glitches present in Among Us. The last round I played the impostor was the only one remaining but the round was continuing. The black screen glitch is extremely common and sometimes the lobby glitches into the map and the game is unplayable. Second reason: The game barely updates. Ever since I started playing the game, the biggest update (not including bug fixes) was the chat assist and that is about the only new thing I can name. For a half of a year, practically nothing was added. If you cannot maintain the game properly, then you should sell it to a company that can. Third is the community. Although the developers cannot control this, it still makes the game a bad experience for many players. You may have added what I am about to say already, but if you didn‚Äôt, you should add a age restriction. There are a lot of people that play Among Us who are not very smart and accuse people for no reason and everybody listens without any evidence. This makes the game very easy for the impostor because of how gullible the majority of the community is. And even if you are the impostor it still ruins the game because you can execute it perfectly and still get voted out because ‚ÄúRed sus‚Äù I have stopped playing the game because it just never added anything new and became very bland.

There are a few problems though. To name a few, when you use an ad to revive, sometimes you will respawn you end up in an area where you are supposed to be on top of a train, so all 3 lanes have trains coming at you just to kill you again and the only way to survive is to waste a board so you can crash into a train. Also, parts of the game don‚Äôt make sense. For example, you‚Äôll jump over a barrier and then you‚Äôll see a train going down the same lane where the barrier is just to run over it. Trains will also appear out of nowhere. Keys are another huge problem. They are so rare to find and then if you don‚Äôt want to watch an ad to revive, you have to pay at least one key. As you keep dying, you need more and more keys to the point where the amount needed is insanely high. I also would like to see the game have challenges instead of only being able to run on an endless road.

All my peers were chattering about a seemingly endless canvas, a world so filled with animals and landmarks, yet so empty to the creative mind. A world to be filled with whatever you wish, all in your pocket. To this day, I still believe this is the best purchase I have ever made in my lifetime. Any boring, gloomy day was instantly changed upon starting up this masterpiece of an app. Any player regardless of age has the opportunity to escape to a place where your imagination can flow endlessly. A place to escape the sometimes harsh realities of the real world. I am now a teen in highschool, awaiting my days until graduation as well as my days until adult life. I recently started up the app after years of inactivity due to the minuscule amount of time available for leisure nowadays, especially for the average highschool student. I noticed the changes made to the game. And then when sunset arrived, memories came flooding back. The memories of summer nights spent with friends in this little world that taught us so much. A game that taught us to never put a boundary to our imagination. As I reminisced, I realized how much the game has shaped me as a person. As friends, days, months, and years went in and out of my life, this game has always remained by my side. A lifelong friend. Thank you mojang.

That is no reason to give it one star and if you actually give the app a chance I think anybody would like it I think if the only bad comments are the app keeps crashing or the Same stinking thing then that could just be a not updated device so my advice to anybody don‚Äôt knock it till you try it.

It has been about two months. Another problem is that the new update (in my opinion) has made the game look very old and childish. It looks like it is from the 90s. I highly dislike the new style of the game. I also purchased double coins many years ago and now I cannot get it back even when I restore my purchase.

I deleted it after reaching level 20. The reason I deleted it is because it‚Äôs too boring to me. It was interesting fixing up the house but having to use multiple stars for some aspects and even to move to the next day is greedy. The bank I despised. Good premise but it holds coins you earn hostage unless you pay to buy it once you accumulate 3000 or 5000 coins. There is no choice either, you watch your coins disappear. The small mini games shown in the ads are the best part but they are way too few and far between. The majority of this game is playing levels over and over trying to get the next star to fix the never ending repairs. I also found having to use stars to open packages annoying. If I‚Äôm getting a gift it should be just. There is some humor and the scenes are colorful which is why i gave it two stars. Had the earning of coins been much higher, the mini games much more prevalent, the bank either free to obtain or at least an option, the limiting of one star per repair and not having to use stars on anything other than repairs I could have seen playing this longer.

When adding houses to the purple properties, the add houses button extends over the purple properties making it difficult to add properties there. I find myself accidentally not buying a property because the buy or not buy buttons are too close together. Maybe a different layout for buying properties. For games against the computer it would be nice to limit the number of times the computer offers a trade. It gets to the point where it is offering trades on every dice roll which slows the game down. For the custom rule set, having an option to start the game with more money would be nice.

The other reason I am writing this four stars is because of the AI players sometimes make a terrible trading deal, where one AI ends up with a full street and ready to build houses, where the other is still needing another street, so basically getting the short end of the stick. Dumb moves like that typically put one AI player way ahead of everybody else early in the game, and I would never make a move like that to help one player start building houses before I would be able to do so as well.

I now from experience; I am on level 1147 and it takes a while to beat some levels, but, they ARE NOT IMPOSSIBLE. Also, the ads that they show are not what the game is and I was disappointed to see them myself since I like the game a lot and wish they would just have ads that are what the game is. Instead, the game is a candy crush style game where you get stars and coins for every level you beat. With the stars you can customize your mansion and continue the story of a butler and his family. The coins are just meant to be saved up to buy power ups and refill lives (the lives regenerate). This has been an honest review of the game from me.P.S - Joining Houses/Teams is a very good idea because you get coins when teammates buy passes, and teammates can HELP you on levels your stumped on as well as give you lives when your out.",With the stars you can customize your mansion and continue the story of a butler and his family.,5,True,general,positive,5

But you reach a certain point where you have to have boosters to beat the levels, & because Playtrix only gives you a max of 70 coins for each level beat (a taudry amount considering what things cost in the game), you end up spending  your own money  to be able to keep playing levels, or to be able to buy boosters to beat the levels. To break it down for you: I‚Äôm at level 122 (which is impossible to beat without a booster because of how it is set up), which is about midway through the 5th decoration level in the game (haven‚Äôt even broached the upstairs level yet). I‚Äôve already spent $60 on coins/boosters, & I‚Äôve only been playing 2 weeks. Not going to spend anymore $ on this (even though I enjoy it) simply on principle. The rewards for levels are not anywhere close to what they should be, & the amounts you get for what you pay for aren‚Äôt enough either. In other games if you spent $20 you would be set for a couple weeks. This game ends up being a days at most because of demand for boosters/coins to the cost ratio.

It helps the time go by quickly.  The only thing that bothers me is the hard and extra hard part of the game.  I realize that it breaks up the monotony, but, I spend days sometimes trying to beat the level.  But, it is good that the hard and extra hard are few and far between, so it‚Äôs not overwhelming, it‚Äôs a good change of pace. And, as others have said, rewards are few and far between as well.  Especially with the hard levels, the rewards are just this: your normal level low coin reward is doubled and you are rewarded with one extra star.  I know you have to make money in this venture, but, your doing it to the detriment of your customers.  There is a reason we play games that say that they are free, it‚Äôs because a lot of us do not have the funds to use actual money to progress farther in the game faster then the other players that can afford to use their hard earned money.  In conclusion, I think this game is well worth 5 stars, however, I did only give it 4 stars on account of the hard and very hard levels & the lack of well deserved rewards.  I think there should be better rewards and it should be a little easier to get stars.  Just my opinion for what it‚Äôs worth.

Great, mindless way to decompress after a long day. The update however.... I just downloaded the most recent update to the update and it seems to be a bit better. The controls are still a bit whacked out. It seems to have a hard time figuring out that you are trying to move left when in midair. Always seems to want to roll or jump instead. I do not notice the same when moving right. The pogo sticks need some reworking. I can rarely see which lane the prize is in at the end of the jump. Finally, some of the challenges have not been working. I had one with no rolls or jumps in a certain number of points that would not increment or ever reach success criteria no matter how long I went. Then suddenly would declare success out of the blue.

For those of you who don‚Äôt have the game what I mean is that people under 18 have to use the quick chat feature instead of saying whatever. But if you‚Äôre over 18 you can use free chat and say whatever you want. I feel that the age limit should be 13 or 14 instead of 18. Like, the majority of this game‚Äôs players are under 18 and I don‚Äôt think that people over 13 really need that level of ‚Äúinternet safety‚Äù protection. Second of all with this new quick chat it takes away some of the things that you want to say about who the imposter is and why you are suspicious of them and whatnot. Some things are so unique you just need to put them in your own words. For example the other day I was playing and I saw Orange running away from a dead body. I reported the body but there was no option to say ‚Äú(A) was running away from the body.‚Äù Some things are so unlikely or one-time happenings that they don‚Äôt have options to say it, but when it does happen you can‚Äôt do anything about it.

Now I think this could be a good idea, but I have to disagree. You see I think this will discourage players to use the regular typing chat we already have, and for players that A. aren‚Äôt allowed to talk to strangers. And B. Don‚Äôt have a mic, or just are in a crowded room, would not be able to experience the game! Because if they couldn‚Äôt use the voice chat they wouldn‚Äôt be able to hear or talk because everyone would be using the voice chat, the regular chat would be obsolete. And that would make those people stop playing among us! Which would not be very helpful to your company. Also I have read about the hide and seek mode, and really think that should be added along with other modes; because the game as is, gets boring after a month or so. Personally I haven‚Äôt played this game in months because of the lack of variety, I also think a friend system is the #1 thing you need right now because when players who have bonded over a few games are lost to each other forever when they quit/disconnect. All in all it is a very good game with neat gameplay, I just think you need to think about your future because even a game this fun can die fast. Definitely recommend.","And B.

Then pretty much everyone should be giving you five stars. Consider me a genius. Jk!! Anywho Minecraft is a real hit to my family and improvements is gonna be awesome!!!!!!! Also make lags fixed because sometimes it lags and I‚Äôm on survival and a mob is hitting me. When it lags I die! And I have pretty good stuff on survival.

I started playing from around age 6 and have enjoyed playing this game for 6 years. Even though I feel I‚Äôve only gotten decent recently I think this game is really fun. Not matter your trying to survive the night with your friends in survival, or building the mansion of your dreams in creative, best game ive ever played and has sculpted me as a gamer and in real life from the way I think of architecture and design. I can still remember being scared out my socks when I was only a kindle fire and it was day in the desert, and I went into a cave, then it was pitch black, I started to spin, and then I was lost. No escape. I was in survival for the first time which made it worse. Then Im spinning trying to see a light going deeper and deeper and BOOM! Got blown up by a creeper, let‚Äôs say I stuck to creative for a bit lol üòÇ. I love going on the MC discord and looking at all the amazing feedback I get from other players now that I have some actual good idea of what I‚Äôm doing and I‚Äôm trying to figure out redstone. One thing I would suggest, stop advertising the game as a game for little kids because even though I‚Äôm a kid I know when I‚Äôm an adult if you keep updating I‚Äôll still be playing!

But recently the game was updated so that anyone under the age of 18 can not type what they want or need to say. I see that they were trying to fix the problem of swearing and online dating but it just wasn‚Äôt the right way to fix the problem. The game used to be so enjoyable, and now I probably won‚Äôt be playing it again. There are many other ways to fix this problem, but restricting what people can type so that they can‚Äôt get their point across is not the way to do it. If this was removed I definitely would give it a 5 star review, but unfortunately this update has ruined the game for me, my friends and my family.EDIT: I won‚Äôt be playing the game again I‚Äôve tried to get over the update but I can‚Äôt. To be honest you ruined your own game. The bulk of people that play are teens and now we have no freedom. We get all of these restrictions everywhere and you had to add among to that list. I‚Äôm very disappointed. If you could lower the age for safe chat from 18 to 13 that would be great. 18 is very unrealistic compared to 13 which is much more reasonable. Also look at all of the reviews your getting. People aren‚Äôt happy and your star level is dropping. I‚Äôll let that speak for itself. Just change the game back or tweak the update please.

I enjoy playing this with my friends, we all have a good time! Although you don‚Äôt know people you play with in random servers it‚Äôs fun playing with them to. So like I was explaining how the game is a fun experience there is also some issues I have with it. One being the hackers (you probably did something about that already, my bad if you already did) and lots and of glitches. I always get kicked out of the game due to an error or some weird glitch. I also have a problem with some of the people in the game treat it as if it‚Äôs tinder and flirt with people in the game. I know there‚Äôs probably no fixing that but it kinda gets annoying being for them to be like that. Also, I think you should make like a friend thing where like you can befriend people in the game and they can send you ( or you send them) friend request and when either of you accept then you can chat with them and join the same game as them so you don‚Äôt have to go through like hundreds of other servers to see them again. And for the last, it would be nice to add Charles to the stickmin bundle (this isn‚Äôt really a problem but it would be cool to have him in UwUüíû).

I remember when there was a girl in Minecraft, and the old avatars.. (Notch messed up a bit..) it‚Äôs a fun and awesome game. The days of beta were the best. I remember surprise Friday or Friday surprise, but then it stopped. Until an exception- Surprise Saturday. Ah yes. I remember why polar bears were added in the game, and the reason. Jeb‚Äôs wife (I think it‚Äôs Jeb‚Äôs..) liked polar bears, so that‚Äôs why they were added. The original Mobil lite version, and I remember when Minecraft PE was free. All this time it‚Äôs been downloaded in my cloud storage, so I never had to buy it. (Heh) This game never stops improving. But of course, I‚Äôm more of a Java version myself, of course. The days of me and the boys, staying up all night, gaming, building whatever we could. I also remember the day when Microsoft bought Mojang, or did they buy Minecraft? Anyways. The first minecon was about 30 people, mostly Notches‚Äô family. The good ol days of Minecraft. A few things could be changed though. The shooting speed of skeletons is very high, I dislike that, I have some other things, but I don‚Äôt want to keep you from doing your jobs. Thanks so much for these amazing 12 years of Minecraft!

I feel like you should really add a friend system! That way you can send friend requests to people you would like to join‚Äôs game. Something that I find very annoying, is when your in the middle of playing, then get kicked out and it says: ‚ÄúSent 6 pings‚Äù or the ‚Äúunreliable packet source‚Äù or something. Its really annoying how you can be playing and then boom. Back to the main menu you go! So that‚Äôs something I would like if you fixed it. And finally, the trolls. I hate when people will join a game and ask ‚Äúhey any (insert gender) here?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs ur snap?‚Äù ‚ÄúHey how old are you?‚Äù It‚Äôs really uncomfortable. Also when people say inappropriate things like private things to other strangers. It gets me disgusted. So I thought something thst could help with that is banning. If someone is beign really rude,or innapropriate I (and many others) would appreciate it if the game can ban them for maybe 30 minutes. So they can still play, but it‚Äôs later. Like a punishment for acting however they did. But I cannot say that this game is bad. I am really enjoying the newest update very much!

First was ads that would play after clicking on the home icon. I don‚Äôt mind ads that I choose to watch because I want to double my reward, but I don‚Äôt want to see ads when moving from one screen to the next. The most recent major annoyance is the red exclamation point on the Shop button. After I click the daily reward and the offers, the red exclamation point still remains. What the heck?!? I don‚Äôt want to keep seeing it. Yes, I know there are special offers, and the daily reward is ready, but what else? The third annoyance is ads within ads. What is this new type of purgatory? I see a screen playing a different ad within the ad that‚Äôs playing. And the last annoyance (for now, anyway) is that the sound is not always off even when the phone is on silent. What if I were in an important board meeting and surreptitiously playing Subway Surfers and the sound for the ad bursts out? If I silence the game, I expect the ads to be silenced as well.

And some tasks are just ridiculous to even warrant a star! Make a call, move an object, can take 2 stars at times!! It makes it extremely hard and tedious to advance in the game. Not to mention the coins, you only get at max about 100 coins depending on what level you beat, but if you want extra moves it 900 coins!!! Ok, you do the math.... when it‚Äôs all said and done you have to spend money on extra lives to beat the boards, on coins to advance in the levels and get the stars you need in order to fix things to advance!  As the boards get harder we should get more stars, Hard=2 stars, Super Hard=3 stars and so forth, as we advance in the game tasks cost more stars so we should naturally EARN more stars to off set it!

The story lines are cute as well.  Some of the story items cost way too much compared other games and honestly nothing should cost more than 2 stars, let alone stuff that costs 6.  That‚Äôs ridiculous and no other game does it.Speaking of... so when you have to clear 6 game boards to complete a story line task, every one counts, and often you may use a booster for that last piece with your last move.  Only on occasion, when the board is NOT MOVING, an airplane will go take out some random piece that has nothing to do with advancing the game.

I love seeing all of the different updates that are added. Recently, I went at least 2 months without playing which really sucked (STAY IN SCHOOL KIDS) but when I did return to my Minecraft world, there was so much new stuff waiting for me to explore! I think survival is a fun mode if you‚Äôre up for a challenge. Then there are people like me. I start with creative and build everything I want (sometimes I get lucky and find a village) and stock up on everything. I mean EVERYTHING. From food to blocks to animals to weapons, I never want to be caught by a monster in survival without the proper weapon! The villagers are really fun to trade with. When I play Minecraft, I listen to the sound on my airpods and I love the noise that villagers make! I recently made a new world titled ‚ÄúCovid is killing my brain cells‚Äù where I used everything from the inventory. I have my own little zoo and a very enforced prison where I keep the monsters. Ok I didn‚Äôt use EVERYTHING. I didn‚Äôt use endermans because (1) they scare the heck out of me and (2) they could just teleport out of their prison cell and murder me ruthlessly in my sleep.

The game is fun and requires lots of skill or just fast fingers. My only problems are the prices of some of the items. For the characters I think they can get a little bit pricey. When you get a mystery box it can give you items that help you unlock characters. I honestly think that it might take a month or almost a year to reach the amount because I‚Äôm not joking, they are really pricey. Unless you playing it nonstop without taking your eyes off the screen then it might take a few weeks. But that‚Äôs still a while. Also the hover boards. They can also get a little pricey. And why buy something that you can only use in certain times. It makes it worse that they can get really expensive. Honestly I think their pretty cool but please lower the prices. The last thing you might need to fix is the add lag. Sometimes it will start freezing up and you have to restart the app and that‚Äôs a little annoying in my opinion. I also think that you should only have to face adds if your getting something for free. Other than those issues I truly love the game!

Two really cool characters I would LOVE to have you guys bring back is Mimi and Rabbot. I missed both of them and couldn‚Äôt get a chance to have them as characters. Speaking of Mimi, if I‚Äôm correct she does have a pet otter which is super cute. I don‚Äôt know if the otter runs with her when she is trying to evade the inspector, but if it does I think that the Subway Surfers team should have a pet isle where players can choose an animal to run with them like the inspector has a dog. I would absolutely DIE if that could happen. I also definitely think that younger players would enjoy this. Please consider because I think it will definitely draw more attention to this amazing game. Besides that I think this game has amazing graphics and deserves to have ‚Äúhype‚Äù I also like how you guys make different maps that represent different parts of the world.

Coins are sold in the shop for .99 cents per 900 which is crazy expensive considering 900 coins will on get 5 additional moves or 3 destroy balls (not sure what they are actually called). If 5 mores moves is not enough to complete the level the next 5 cost 1200 coins. The puzzles are designed to require boosts or additional moves. Each puzzle won rewards a star. Stars are required to perform actions for upgrading the garden or home. Though it is satisfying to watch the transformations and improvements I get frustrated when required to spend a star to greet someone at the door to receive a package, then another star to open the package. All the extra actions not related to actual upgrades seems like a complete waste of stars considering the difficulty of obtaining them.  One good thing added to the game is the option to watch commercials to receive coins.

They're pop-up, not videos, so they don't disrupt your game. However, like all games, this one has some problems. My biggest issue is the top run. Every week, the contestants get harder to beat, and eventually you can't get past the last person in the silver because they have over a million. Also, if you get a really good medal, like the diamond, you don't get to keep it for the next week because it changes depending on where you are that week. Another problem is the keys. To revive yourself, you have to pay more and more each time, until it gets so expensive that you can't even afford it. The only way to get keys is in the run, in mystery boxes, or in awards, which is a huge problem because: you only find a key in a run about every eighteen games or so, and if you miss it, then you don't have a chance to get another one. It is extremely rare to get a key in a mystery box, and when you do, it's only one, which can't even begin to pay for the expenses of reviving yourself. It takes a long time to earn a reward, which only gives you three keys, five if you're lucky.

You only get about 50-80 coins a game after completing the level, but in order to get more chances to play it‚Äôs 900 coins for the first 5 extra moves and then goes up to 1200. I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs after that, because it‚Äôs just so much! Even with the rewards they grant, you only get 100 coins which is like nothing. You really have to spend money to play this game. I‚Äôve tried to be patient and play the games out without spending money, but many levels you just can‚Äôt! I don‚Äôt mind spending the money here and there, but it‚Äôs so expensive, it doesn‚Äôt even make it worth it. You get 1000 coins for .99 and it takes 900 coins to get 5 extra turns. That adds up really quick! Plus it‚Äôs even more expensive if you want power ups! I‚Äôm not too sure how much more I can continue playing if they don‚Äôt make some changes. It‚Äôs beginning to add up with how many coins I‚Äôve been buying just to beat rounds. On top of that I believe that there are also sometimes when the board isn‚Äôt applying the power ups correctly. It's almost like a glitch or something that‚Äôs not working. I‚Äôm really hoping they make some changes to this game!

Even when a whole side of color schemes has been bought up and houses/hotels applied, they always seem to skip over those spaces until the game comes down to human player and AI.

The math or algorithm behind the dice roll needs to be addressed before I can enjoy this game. COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY unless you have people around you and can play locally.

But the ads that I see for this game while I‚Äôm playing other games don‚Äôt make any sense at all: they are completely misleading and don‚Äôt have anything to do with the Actual gameplay. When I first downloaded this game it was because of an ad that I‚Äôd seen, and the demo allowed me to pick out which furniture, which wallpaper, etc. Then I downloaded Homescapes and played, even spent some money on it because I was having fun and wanted to keep progressing. Now all the ads I see for this game don't make sense. I see some where the main characters are trapped on an island and they are being attacked by a shark, some where they are stranded in the cold and freezing, and within the last couple days I saw two more that DONT MAKE SENSE! The guy has to pee and he‚Äôs running down the hall and things are breaking. Then the reason I wrote this review is because I was so confused and disturbed by the one I just saw: the guy has his hands and feet tied to bed posts and the room is on fire and he wants to escape. That seems macabre and violent; who tied him there... his parents? It‚Äôs creepy when you compare it to the actual innocent and child friendly gameplay. What in the world was that ad?! Why would you make that strange violent ad to promote this game? I‚Äôm disturbed... lol... it‚Äôs been months and months since I‚Äôve seen an ad that depicts anything similar to the actual gameplay. :/","Then I downloaded Homescapes and played, even spent some money on it because I was having fun and wanted to keep progressing.",3,True,cost,positive,1

It‚Äôs pretty bad when you start a match with no moves and it has to reshuffle. Power ups can be hit or miss at the start. Towards the higher levels you‚Äôll start off with a very small section and you‚Äôll have to open the rest of the field but you‚Äôll end up wasting 3 or 4 moves before you can even do that. Some levels seem impossible to beat without the RNG gods giving you tons of power ups. You‚Äôll often lose by 1 move which prompts you to use coins to buy 5 more moves. If you don‚Äôt have the coins, that‚Äôs when they hit you with the pay to win aspect of it. As many other people have said, it often feels like the game is working against you maliciously so you‚Äôll be forced to buy more coins or power ups. It gets extremely frustrating playing the same level thirty times and losing by 1 move over and over. This is the same for both gardenscapes and homescapes (and probably the other games by the same developers). Bottom lines is you can pretty much tell by mid match if you‚Äôre going to beat the level or not. If you still have 75% of the objectives to complete and you‚Äôve been forced to waste 3 or 4 moves in a row and you have less than 10 moves left, you‚Äôre not gonna win.

Every day of every round I have to keep on pressing a X. Like STOP. Another thing is that the power ups are so short! They only last like five seconds.

They‚Äôre also charging $30 for a season pass that I believe features strictly cosmetics. üôÑ Marmalade, if you want our money at least give us a solid game. Another complaint I have is the only games rules we have to choose from are: Classic and Quick mode. It would be nice to have the options to change the rules/play custom games and whatnot. To the Monopoly fans, tread carefully because this game was clearly developed as a cash grab and not to give us the mobile Monopoly we would expect in 2020. The base gameplay is acceptable, but the flaws make the game close to unplayable.",You want to charge $4 for a board game and not let us speak to each other?,1,True,cost,negative,1

I deleted it after reaching level 20. The reason I deleted it is because it‚Äôs too boring to me. It was interesting fixing up the house but having to use multiple stars for some aspects and even to move to the next day is greedy. The bank I despised. Good premise but it holds coins you earn hostage unless you pay to buy it once you accumulate 3000 or 5000 coins. There is no choice either, you watch your coins disappear. The small mini games shown in the ads are the best part but they are way too few and far between. The majority of this game is playing levels over and over trying to get the next star to fix the never ending repairs. I also found having to use stars to open packages annoying. If I‚Äôm getting a gift it should be just. There is some humor and the scenes are colorful which is why i gave it two stars. Had the earning of coins been much higher, the mini games much more prevalent, the bank either free to obtain or at least an option, the limiting of one star per repair and not having to use stars on anything other than repairs I could have seen playing this longer. I tried these match three types of games several times now and always delete them quickly once the repetition of levels hits.

The tasks/mini games are probably one of the best parts about this game, each one feels fun to do, especially if you can get a rhythm for each task.

I enjoy playing this with my friends, we all have a good time! Although you don‚Äôt know people you play with in random servers it‚Äôs fun playing with them to. So like I was explaining how the game is a fun experience there is also some issues I have with it. One being the hackers (you probably did something about that already, my bad if you already did) and lots and of glitches. I always get kicked out of the game due to an error or some weird glitch. I also have a problem with some of the people in the game treat it as if it‚Äôs tinder and flirt with people in the game. I know there‚Äôs probably no fixing that but it kinda gets annoying being for them to be like that. Also, I think you should make like a friend thing where like you can befriend people in the game and they can send you ( or you send them) friend request and when either of you accept then you can chat with them and join the same game as them so you don‚Äôt have to go through like hundreds of other servers to see them again. And for the last, it would be nice to add Charles to the stickmin bundle (this isn‚Äôt really a problem but it would be cool to have him in UwUüíû). Overall that is all I have to say about the game, thank you for making this terrific game for family‚Äôs around the world.

So I was saving up for all five of the Christmas people, and I finally got 100 keys, so I got it and then left the app. Then I went back in it later and it said I had 93 keys... I was super confused, so I went into the me section where my boards and characters are to see if I still had my Christmas people, but I accidentally bought a character. And I also had the Christmas people too. After being way too confused I got out for the day. Then, this morning i went on to get my daily snowflakes and words and it wouldn‚Äôt let me watch an ad when I died. I had to use keys. Now, I still had 30-something, but if I continued like that, with the amount of time I spend on the game, those keys would be gone super soon. So, if anyone can help me or tell me what happened, that would be great, thanks.

If so I would recommend picking up your phone and download Subway Surfers. I love to just sit back and run on the train tracks for hours. What I love about this game is how they make it have a really cool theme. The characters are all so cool and at the start You are spray painting and the police come running after you. Sometimes I feel like I am in the game itself. I like how they give you head starters and the font and if you die they sometime let you come back alive after just watching a video. The only down side about the game is he hover boards and the characters are all SO MANY coins and keys. I am never able to get that many coins and keys. I just try to get enough coins to get the character Lucy, and her scary outfit or whatever it is called. Then I just play the game and like a month later I will try to see how much I can pay for. I also hate how all you do in the game is run on train tracks with a few of the same obstacles in your way. I just sometimes wish there could be more obstacles or Like different courses you take.

There needs to be some sort of timer for everything so that way the game can keep moving or if someone doesn‚Äôt make any moves for a long period of time or purposely leaves the game they should go bankrupt and their properties should either get auctioned off or return back to the board for the other people to buy in the future. It‚Äôs super annoying having to leave a game because nobody is moving or being sore losers. I don‚Äôt have any interest in playing this game anymore because of this. It takes so long to even start getting to a place where you‚Äôre making money and getting people to land on your properties so going through all that just to quit because someone doesn‚Äôt want to play the game anymore is annoying.

There are a few suggestions that I would like to make though. The first suggestion is decreasing the prices for the avatars. I just think they‚Äôre a little bit expensive. Don‚Äôt get me wrong they‚Äôre great characters, but bumping down the price a little wouldn‚Äôt hurt. The second suggestion is offering more discounts on things like coins and prize boxes in the game. Maybe you could even call it Discount Day or Discount Week. The last suggestion is putting more missions in the game. Like for example, having the game players find LIMITED EDITION Gold boxes along the trail, that are filled with SUPER RARE things like unlocking special characters or getting a BIG amount of gems or coins. Other than these few suggestions, this game is amazingly fun! I like how it travels around the world to a new location every other month, and has characters that you buy from that specific location to go along with the theme!

Just an interesting spin to make the game a little more addictive.  The little side quests like trophy challenges and the parrot gifts are super helpful. However I will say sometimes you are gifted 30 min unlimited game play and you don‚Äôt really have an option of when to use it. So if I am getting in a quick game on a break or before dinner and I am gifted one of those it goes to waste if I can‚Äôt continue to play for an extra 30 min.  Not going to lie, at those moments It really is frustrating because you get only 5 lives and the regeneration rate is slow. In addition the buy rate for items feels a little high. As an example to buy an extra 5 moves at the end of a tough level is 900 coins. You maybe get 55 coins for beating a level. So you have to tear through 18 levels to earn enough to buy that extension.  It actually de-incentivizes me to buy a package because it never really feels like you are getting a deal.  That being said if you can play and not get frustrated when you get stuck on a level for days, or are willing to pay for buy ups this game rocks.",In addition the buy rate for items feels a little high.,4,True,cost,negative,1

I don't want to stop playing but I run out of lives so I have no choice. Lol. I think I like it better than Gardenscapes and I love Gardenscapes too.  I like how you can put different types of explosives together or two of the same to make a bigger explosive. It would be even greater if you could put more than two together. I've had three explosives lined together but I can't mix all three together. I haven't had 4 or more alined but that would be more awesome. With Gardenscapes it seems like I'm not able to complete and able to upgrade or rebuild anything as quickly as I seem to be able to with Homescapes. So if you wanted to change something with Gardenscapes that would be one thing.  I guess it's a little harder to complete a level. You can't mix two explosives like you can with Homescapes. It's just totally different with the match game with Homescapes it seems to me. I love it and I can't get enough of it. I'm always wondering what the next level is going to be like.

The reward to effort is completely unfair. The base reward is 50 coins while the cost for boosts, extended moves, or just about anything is 900 coins or more. Coins are sold in the shop for .99 cents per 900 which is crazy expensive considering 900 coins will on get 5 additional moves or 3 destroy balls (not sure what they are actually called). If 5 mores moves is not enough to complete the level the next 5 cost 1200 coins. The puzzles are designed to require boosts or additional moves. Each puzzle won rewards a star. Stars are required to perform actions for upgrading the garden or home. Though it is satisfying to watch the transformations and improvements I get frustrated when required to spend a star to greet someone at the door to receive a package, then another star to open the package. All the extra actions not related to actual upgrades seems like a complete waste of stars considering the difficulty of obtaining them.

Real players wouldn‚Äôt do half of this stuff   Sometimes it appears that the dice roll is not random.  Sometimes the chance or community chest cards can be the same thing on back to back draws. Who goes first, second, third is flawed because it depends upon how you are listed and who rolls the highest dice when playing against the A.I players.   Not as much animation is needed which may help the battery drain or at least give an option to turn some of that off. So many things in each turn slow the whole game down and could be altered to keep it moving. Why not put the property cards displaying in the lower right rather than taking up the whole screen.

Almost every cycle I landed on his two properties and yet many times the ai only landed on a chance, just visiting, income tax, or community passing through unscathed on my side of the board.

However, it is far too common for a player to get disconnected or for the game to freeze, ultimately ruining the entire game and leading me to have wasted 2 hours of my time. Also, it is hard to differentiate when a player is simply not paying attention, forgets to roll, or forgets to end their turn so it would be EXTREMELY USEFUL to have a ******chat function****** or at least a button the players could use to notify other players when the game has come to a standstill. I really hope that the monopoly app creators will take these suggestions into account as I have recommended the app to many people and know they have experienced the same frustration as me. Also, it would be awesome if their was a way to pause the game (which I know may actually difficult due to connection issues). Additionally, the game disconnects when someone gets a phone call or even if low battery signal pops up on a players phone. Sometimes the bots will pick up and play for the disconnected user but other times the game is screwed. Regardless, I love how the game is customizable and has great layouts.

It‚Äôs super fun even when your not playing with friends. I know many people have an opinion on this (most of them good) so I just thought I spread the word even more. I feel like you should really add a friend system! That way you can send friend requests to people you would like to join‚Äôs game. Something that I find very annoying, is when your in the middle of playing, then get kicked out and it says: ‚ÄúSent 6 pings‚Äù or the ‚Äúunreliable packet source‚Äù or something. Its really annoying how you can be playing and then boom. Back to the main menu you go! So that‚Äôs something I would like if you fixed it. And finally, the trolls. I hate when people will join a game and ask ‚Äúhey any (insert gender) here?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs ur snap?‚Äù ‚ÄúHey how old are you?‚Äù It‚Äôs really uncomfortable. Also when people say inappropriate things like private things to other strangers. It gets me disgusted. So I thought something thst could help with that is banning. If someone is beign really rude,or innapropriate I (and many others) would appreciate it if the game can ban them for maybe 30 minutes. So they can still play, but it‚Äôs later. Like a punishment for acting however they did. But I cannot say that this game is bad. I am really enjoying the newest update very much!

Since so many new updates Dame about bug fixes, oh yeah. Now I'm starting to play Minecraft more. But... There is just one problem. I don't know how to activate my behavior packs. When I got on Addons for Minecraft PE, I saw this cool behavior pack called Better Drops. I installed it. But it was a behavior pack. When I got back on Minecraft, I got to my settings, but the add-on wasn't in the Resource Packs setting thingymajober. I got confused. I went to Storage, and I saw the Better Drops add-on. Except that it won't let me activate it. That's weird. Please tell me how to activate behavior packs. Also, I have a suggestion. Minecraft just got boring because there were no other items that are really decorative, like when you want to build a house, you needed a toilet. But there is no toilet in Minecraft. Mods like Decocraft mod and Bibliocraft mod have many other items that are decorative for a house, but sadly there are no mods for Minecraft PE. What I mean by this is that mods don't work on Minecraft PE. There are only Addons, but really Addons just REPLACE other items. Please add more items like toilets or TVs and more in Minecraft!

I love this game! The idea is classic, like mafia but in space. It can be technically called a brain game because the idea of lying and deceiving your ‚Äúteam‚Äù is very cool way to stretch your detective skills. Personally, this game is really fun! I wouldn‚Äôt give this game anything below 5 stars! But, there are a lot of things that concern me a little to. First, the over usage of bad words and #. It‚Äôs pretty hard to find a game where no one is constantly cussing inappropriate things in the chat, which ruins the game for everyone! On the other hand, there are some ridiculous hashtags marked on a word that isn‚Äôt even bad! Some people also put very disgusting things as their names. Another thing I would like to suggest is adding friends! Me and my friend just started playing together yesterday but it was very hard to get her into the same game as I am. Sometimes it‚Äôs very boring if we start a new game as host and no one‚Äôs joining!

One last thing, smart AI for Freeplay. I read someone else‚Äôs review and I too would love to have smarter AI as an option. This game is amazing. Edit: so I just had an idea. For the Charles headphone hat, maybe there could be an alternative broken headphones because of the Valiant Hero ending?

But even though they have been add new updates to Minecraft I feel they haven‚Äôt been adding things that really would make Minecraft wayyyyyyy better. I love the dolphins and turtles but couldn‚Äôt they add a few more like perhaps turkey or peacocks. I know you can easily get mods for these things but some cost money. I also think that they should add more dog breeds if there weren‚Äôt just a wolf I would have a lot more dogs. Like maybe they could have huskies pugs Pomeranians Shibas Chiwawas and Great Danes these are all great dog breeds. They could have which dog you get by the color of the wolf you tame like huskies would be white wolfs and Great Danes could be brown wolfs. I think you should also be able to tame polar bears turtles and dolphins and after you tame them you can saddle them and ride them. I also think that fish bowls should be a thing because if you catch a fish than you can put it in a fish bowl and depending on the amount of glass you use you get a different sized fish bowl.

But it won‚Äôt let me even open it.,"(Keep in mind, this is the mobile version, PE) It‚Äôs such a great game and I love it, but recently it‚Äôs been getting more buggy than ever. A few glitches that I have experienced that get very annoying are things such as, when a friend joins, I‚Äôll be wearing their skin, and they‚Äôll be wearing mine (in their POV). It gets annoying when I join only to be wearing their skin. Another thing is that the game constantly kicks me out. I‚Äôll be playing and my screen will freeze a lot. Keep in mind, I‚Äôve tried everything. I‚Äôve deleted tons of apps, cleared data from things, just to make sure that I have space on my device (and it‚Äôs not that). The most recent glitch for me, however, (which is why I‚Äôm writing this) doesn‚Äôt even let me into the game. I‚Äôve tried purging all my apps again to clear even more space and I don‚Äôt know what else to do. It gets to the last couple of bars in the loading screen and freezes. It doesn‚Äôt kick me out, just freezes on that and won‚Äôt go into the game. I‚Äôm becoming impatient, waiting for it to go into the game and it still won‚Äôt. I swipe up the app then go on it again, only for the same result, over and over. No matter how many apps I‚Äôve had before, it‚Äôs never done this and I don‚Äôt know what to do.

It got to the point where I can accurately predict my rolls. If I own 80% of the board, they will only land on the other 20% and that happens 100% of the time. The computer makes trades amongst themselves that aren‚Äôt fair, they‚Äôre only helping each other get sets to knock you out of the game. If you have hotels, the AI WILL NOT LAND ON THEM. Only between your hotels. It‚Äôs laughable at how predictable it is. If a 6 will land you on their hotel, you will roll that 6. I had a property of every color in my last game to ensure no one can build, so what happens? Yup, I land on their railroads only. So what do I do? I buy one of their railroads for a ridiculous price. The next turn, the computer acquired a railroad from another computer to re up the price. I know what you are thinking, why wouldn‚Äôt they buy that railroad prior so that they had all 4? Nah, only when I take the railroad away are they ALL OF A SUDDEN interested. It‚Äôs insanity how much they fix the games in favor of the computer.

Minecraft is one of the best games out there at least for me it is. I basically grew up playing it on my xbox 360. Nothing wrong with the gameplay or anything. But I do have one complaint. Now i‚Äôm not entirely sure if this a bug or a glitch so it might be nothing but it bothers me. So basically I play on the server: MineVille City. And when i go into one the minigames, that minigame being High-School Roleplay there are problems with my custom skin. So idk if this has to do with the server but this has happened most of the time. I walk around and when i pull up the pause menu my custom skin is replaced with a random skin. And I sometimes see other players with my skin equipped. And idk if my skin is working or not. Even when i do the inventory menu my custom skin is still there. So Mojang, if you see this then please reach out to me. My Minecraft account is a Xbox live account named Endermen21YT. So please if you can, look into this. Now this could totally just be the server or something else so this might not even be happening. I‚Äôve even noticed that this has happened to other ppl before on those servers. And it only happens when I enter the minigame. In the main server my skin‚Äôs fine. So anyway yeah that‚Äôs all.

I first saw it played on Twitch and said I have got to experience this. The graphics, animation and modeling are really fun. Based on old reviews, I think many issues from the past are solved. The network seems reliable and the rules and variations are pretty much on point. The AI players add a new dimension. They are annoying at worst and a wonderful addition for shrewd dealing humans, at best. The klunky repetitious and nonsensical ‚Äúoffers‚Äù they make are pretty bad. And the fact that they only assess deals based on value of the deeds and classifying them as ‚Äúeasy, medium, or hard‚Äù just improves their luck and reduces yours makes them pretty frustrating at times.

I honestly think that it might take a month or almost a year to reach the amount because I‚Äôm not joking, they are really pricey. Unless you playing it nonstop without taking your eyes off the screen then it might take a few weeks. But that‚Äôs still a while. Also the hover boards. They can also get a little pricey. And why buy something that you can only use in certain times. It makes it worse that they can get really expensive. Honestly I think their pretty cool but please lower the prices. The last thing you might need to fix is the add lag. Sometimes it will start freezing up and you have to restart the app and that‚Äôs a little annoying in my opinion.

After playing almost 20 single player matches I found some major flaws. The most annoying being the roll of the dice is not random.

I controlled all property and railroads from the go square to free parking, yes that includes the orange properties!  The opposing side only had boardwalk and park place.

Almost every cycle I landed on his two properties and yet many times the ai only landed on a chance, just visiting, income tax, or community passing through unscathed on my side of the board.

It‚Äôs pretty bad when you start a match with no moves and it has to reshuffle. Power ups can be hit or miss at the start. Towards the higher levels you‚Äôll start off with a very small section and you‚Äôll have to open the rest of the field but you‚Äôll end up wasting 3 or 4 moves before you can even do that. Some levels seem impossible to beat without the RNG gods giving you tons of power ups. You‚Äôll often lose by 1 move which prompts you to use coins to buy 5 more moves. If you don‚Äôt have the coins, that‚Äôs when they hit you with the pay to win aspect of it. As many other people have said, it often feels like the game is working against you maliciously so you‚Äôll be forced to buy more coins or power ups. It gets extremely frustrating playing the same level thirty times and losing by 1 move over and over. This is the same for both gardenscapes and homescapes (and probably the other games by the same developers). Bottom lines is you can pretty much tell by mid match if you‚Äôre going to beat the level or not. If you still have 75% of the objectives to complete and you‚Äôve been forced to waste 3 or 4 moves in a row and you have less than 10 moves left, you‚Äôre not gonna win.

The concept and game idea itself is why people enjoy playing so much. The game allows you to work to deceive and lie to people in a way that is totally expectable socially because it‚Äôs all for sun and games. It‚Äôs the same game over and over and over again yet you still have people returning to play more which really says something about how great it is. I could play like 20 games in a row and never get bored. A lot of people feel this same way which is probably why the game is so successful and although that‚Äôs good, it comes with a price. That price is more content. People need more and more content and if the demand isn‚Äôt met with even small additions like new tasks or new colors for characters then the game will slowly start to die out. A big thing people want is the ability to have friends. You can play like 40 games with the same person and really bond with them and get to know them, only for both of you to be kicked out of the game for an update or hacking or something and you‚Äôd never be able to see them again.

No big deal, it‚Äôs something that can happen sometimes and I can just join right back in. But after 5 minutes it did it again. Then again. And again. Keep in mind I was sitting right next to my router and had all my bars and yet the game kept booting me from the server. I bounced the internet twice and still came out with the same results. Sometimes I would close the entire game and reopen it only to find that the world wouldn‚Äôt even pop up. We were stuck in this complicated dance for over an hour before we decided to call it quits out of utter frustration. There is no way this could just be my internet. Not only was I mere inches away from the router but I was the only one in my house. Nobody else was connected to the internet but me so why did I keep getting booted out of the server?

I recently started up the app after years of inactivity due to the minuscule amount of time available for leisure nowadays, especially for the average highschool student. I noticed the changes made to the game. And then when sunset arrived, memories came flooding back. The memories of summer nights spent with friends in this little world that taught us so much. A game that taught us to never put a boundary to our imagination. As I reminisced, I realized how much the game has shaped me as a person.

There are 2 that really stick out. The first one starts once you get to about 100k score, but gets more prevalent once you get to about 250k. What it happens is, when you jump from the ramp up onto the train, and land on the train, you stay floating, and it won‚Äôt let you jump or roll, once you go to the left or right, it‚Äôs fixed though. That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs fine though, because if you don‚Äôt notice it, it might kill you. The second, and worse of the two comes down to the hit-boxes. This just happened to me right before writing this review. On top of the trains, sometimes you just want to go left or right, but when you try, you stumble into nothing. That just happened to me... two trains in a row and it got me killed. Luckily I had just started the round and it seems to happen in the early stages most often so at least it‚Äôs hard to ruin your high score with that glitch, but that one is much more annoying because you can‚Äôt avoid it. There are a few others that aren‚Äôt as bad, for example, earlier I had super sneakers on and went into a jet pack, paused the game for a bit, then I started running in the air with the jet pack on.

The imposter‚Äôs job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with ‚ÄúConfirm Ejects‚Äù and ‚ÄúVisual Tasks‚Äù on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says ‚Äú(insert anything here) was not An Imposter‚Äù or ‚Äúwas An Imposter‚Äù. With it being the imposter‚Äôs job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! This game is ruled by immature 12 year olds and when they get accused, they break lose. I am not exaggerating, I have heard the N word, the F word, and so many other ridiculously bad and racist words in this game than I did in the real world.

There are a few problems though. To name a few, when you use an ad to revive, sometimes you will respawn you end up in an area where you are supposed to be on top of a train, so all 3 lanes have trains coming at you just to kill you again and the only way to survive is to waste a board so you can crash into a train. Also, parts of the game don‚Äôt make sense. For example, you‚Äôll jump over a barrier and then you‚Äôll see a train going down the same lane where the barrier is just to run over it. Trains will also appear out of nowhere. Keys are another huge problem. They are so rare to find and then if you don‚Äôt want to watch an ad to revive, you have to pay at least one key. As you keep dying, you need more and more keys to the point where the amount needed is insanely high. I also would like to see the game have challenges instead of only being able to run on an endless road. All in all, the game is great, it just needs some minor improvements and maybe some more challenges to get the player excited.",This is a very addicting game and overall I would recommend it.,4,True,general,positive,5

Every time I attempt to open it, the app crashes and yet appears to be running in the background. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling it, I‚Äôve made sure I have the latest version, and I made sure my operating system is up-to-date. After multiple failed attempts, I contacted support. They asked me which operating system I was using, and after getting that info, went radio-silent, offering no support whatsoever and the app still doesn‚Äôt work. Don‚Äôt waste your money!","Every time I attempt to open it, the app crashes and yet appears to be running in the background.",1,True,efficiency,negative,3

The graphics, gameplay, and everything overall is amazing! I was also thinking of some things that could be added. This is something I heard on the internet and isn‚Äôt original, but I wanted to spread it around because it sounds interesting. What if there was a role called ‚ÄúJester‚Äù where their goal is to get ejected, making them win? Sounds like it could be a hit or miss, but I think that‚Äôd be cool. Also a role of ‚ÄúDetective‚Äù sounds interesting. Like, you can give that person the option to take screenshots, so they can have solid alibis/evidence of the imposter, but only they have it, so that the crew mates don‚Äôt have too much of an advantage. They can send the screenshots to the chat, helping out their case (maybe also a limited amount of screenshots so their not overpowered?). Also the idea of adding friends would be cool! It‚Äôs sad you can‚Äôt add anyone, and the strangers you could enjoy playing with you‚Äôll only play with once. It would also be nice to adopt mini crew mates whenever their parent dies, I just think that would be very wholesome. More colors would also be cool, I mean, this is only optional since the colors that are already there are great, but I think it‚Äôs something to keep in mind. But overall, fantastic game! Can‚Äôt wait to see what else will come to it in the future!","The graphics, gameplay, and everything overall is amazing!",5,True,general,positive,5

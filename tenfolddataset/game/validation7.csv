I find them to be fun and even addicting. Although the concept of the game is great, and I‚Äôve only been playing for a short while, something needs to be improved with the coin/lives system. Getting around 50 coins per mini-game, which can take multiple lives to complete, isn‚Äôt sufficient enough. In order to buy a life, 900 coins, you would have to play around 18 rounds just to get enough coins for ONE life. I do not pay money on games, never have never will, but it‚Äôs so frustrating that you may have one move left and instead of paying real cash, not in game coins, you have to wait for a life to replenish just to try and fail at the level again. Each round can take 10+ lives to complete, and it takes quite awhile for the lives to replenish. There should be some kind of reward opportunity other than completing a day, especially because you need to play the mini-games to get stars, in order to complete tasks, to complete the day. That‚Äôs a lot of tasks to do with not a lot of lives/coin rewards!!! If there were events where you can play other mini-games to gain rewards/treasures I think it would be more efficient. I also think 28 minutes is a long time to wait for one single life. I don‚Äôt want to give up on this game with not a lot of time put into it already, but if there is no improvement, I might have to.",If there were events where you can play other mini-games to gain rewards/treasures I think it would be more efficient.,3,True,efficiency,positive,3

Second of all, there has been numerous amount of glitches in the past few days. To start off, it will randomly kick you out of a game while you‚Äôre  in the middle of one. This really makes me mad and frustrated because of how many times it‚Äôs happened. Next, there is a hacker. You will join a game and the screen will be all black and you can free run wherever. Then when you check the chat it has a link telling you random stuff and to vote for trump. This can be really scary for young ones and we should also not bring any thing political into a game that kids are playing for fun. Also, in the text it says it will hack with your WiFi. Which is true, not for me, but people I know. It logs them out of their WiFi and disconnects them where they can or rejoin. I would really recommend to wait to download the app until these bugs have been fixed. Thankfully, they have said that instead of making an ‚ÄúAmomg us #2‚Äù they will wait of and be trying to fix these bugs instead. I would wait until around November, as they said that‚Äôs when it should be fixed. I also say you should be 12+ to have this game.

This is obviously built on that annoying subscription model for premium services. And it‚Äôs not free in the first place. No, I don‚Äôt want to pay extra for a new board or player piece...it‚Äôs just software. Give me a break.Second, there are some pretty bad playability issues. One is initiating trades; the user interface makes it impossible to pick multiple things on the left half of the screen because the player boxes cover the properties. Another is that tapping anywhere near the bottom right when trying to select one of your own properties causes the game to think you tapped the ‚Äúend turn‚Äù button, screwing up your turn. Another horrible gameplay thing is the fact that AI players constantly choose ‚Äúauction‚Äù instead of buying properties outright, which is not at all like how people in real life play the game. Not only that, but the AI player that initiated the auction will bid all the way up to the original cost of the property...why on earth would anyone ever do that? Sloppy gameplay for sure.The older Monopoly game on the App Store, which I purchased long ago, was quite a bit better. This is obviously aimed at milking people for buying new playing boards and player pieces. Pretty gross cash grab.

You only have 20 moves to rid the map of enough boxes to get more yellow and blue on the screen and only what‚Äôs left to collect forty of each color! I know these games aren‚Äôt meant to be easy.

There are a few problems though. To name a few, when you use an ad to revive, sometimes you will respawn you end up in an area where you are supposed to be on top of a train, so all 3 lanes have trains coming at you just to kill you again and the only way to survive is to waste a board so you can crash into a train. Also, parts of the game don‚Äôt make sense. For example, you‚Äôll jump over a barrier and then you‚Äôll see a train going down the same lane where the barrier is just to run over it. Trains will also appear out of nowhere. Keys are another huge problem. They are so rare to find and then if you don‚Äôt want to watch an ad to revive, you have to pay at least one key. As you keep dying, you need more and more keys to the point where the amount needed is insanely high. I also would like to see the game have challenges instead of only being able to run on an endless road.

You CAN win every level with out a power up.  You DO NOT need to spend any money on this game, patience is a virtue (so they say).  I have spent money and lately I haven‚Äôt.  The one thing i do agree with most reviewers on is this... to buy a power up costs wayyy too much money for the amount of coins you receive for passing a level.  To continue a game (at 900 coins) for a move or two costs a fortune considering you really don‚Äôt win much.  To buy three hammers costs too much (1900 coins).

Although the developers cannot control this, it still makes the game a bad experience for many players.

There are a lot of people that play Among Us who are not very smart and accuse people for no reason and everybody listens without any evidence.

Well Austin, being obviously wiser than they, immediately moves back into his parent‚Äôs house and convinces his aging parents to not only stay living in an enormous mansion they can‚Äôt possibly keep up with, but to spare no expense at fixing the monolith up.

This includes pop-up notifications for texts, emails, phone calls, other apps, anything. And especially don‚Äôt think about quickly exiting the app for any reason, that‚Äôs a guaranteed disconnect.

To break it down for you: I‚Äôm at level 122 (which is impossible to beat without a booster because of how it is set up), which is about midway through the 5th decoration level in the game (haven‚Äôt even broached the upstairs level yet). I‚Äôve already spent $60 on coins/boosters, & I‚Äôve only been playing 2 weeks. Not going to spend anymore $ on this (even though I enjoy it) simply on principle.

The game is fun and requires lots of skill or just fast fingers. My only problems are the prices of some of the items. For the characters I think they can get a little bit pricey. When you get a mystery box it can give you items that help you unlock characters. I honestly think that it might take a month or almost a year to reach the amount because I‚Äôm not joking, they are really pricey. Unless you playing it nonstop without taking your eyes off the screen then it might take a few weeks. But that‚Äôs still a while. Also the hover boards. They can also get a little pricey. And why buy something that you can only use in certain times. It makes it worse that they can get really expensive. Honestly I think their pretty cool but please lower the prices. The last thing you might need to fix is the add lag. Sometimes it will start freezing up and you have to restart the app and that‚Äôs a little annoying in my opinion.

The imposter‚Äôs job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with ‚ÄúConfirm Ejects‚Äù and ‚ÄúVisual Tasks‚Äù on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says ‚Äú(insert anything here) was not An Imposter‚Äù or ‚Äúwas An Imposter‚Äù. With it being the imposter‚Äôs job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! This game is ruled by immature 12 year olds and when they get accused, they break lose. I am not exaggerating, I have heard the N word, the F word, and so many other ridiculously bad and racist words in this game than I did in the real world.

It‚Äôs super fun even when your not playing with friends. I know many people have an opinion on this (most of them good) so I just thought I spread the word even more. I feel like you should really add a friend system! That way you can send friend requests to people you would like to join‚Äôs game. Something that I find very annoying, is when your in the middle of playing, then get kicked out and it says: ‚ÄúSent 6 pings‚Äù or the ‚Äúunreliable packet source‚Äù or something. Its really annoying how you can be playing and then boom. Back to the main menu you go! So that‚Äôs something I would like if you fixed it. And finally, the trolls. I hate when people will join a game and ask ‚Äúhey any (insert gender) here?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs ur snap?‚Äù ‚ÄúHey how old are you?‚Äù It‚Äôs really uncomfortable. Also when people say inappropriate things like private things to other strangers. It gets me disgusted. So I thought something thst could help with that is banning. If someone is beign really rude,or innapropriate I (and many others) would appreciate it if the game can ban them for maybe 30 minutes. So they can still play, but it‚Äôs later.

Minecraft is one of the best games out there at least for me it is. I basically grew up playing it on my xbox 360. Nothing wrong with the gameplay or anything. But I do have one complaint. Now i‚Äôm not entirely sure if this a bug or a glitch so it might be nothing but it bothers me. So basically I play on the server: MineVille City. And when i go into one the minigames, that minigame being High-School Roleplay there are problems with my custom skin. So idk if this has to do with the server but this has happened most of the time. I walk around and when i pull up the pause menu my custom skin is replaced with a random skin. And I sometimes see other players with my skin equipped. And idk if my skin is working or not. Even when i do the inventory menu my custom skin is still there. So Mojang, if you see this then please reach out to me. My Minecraft account is a Xbox live account named Endermen21YT. So please if you can, look into this. Now this could totally just be the server or something else so this might not even be happening. I‚Äôve even noticed that this has happened to other ppl before on those servers. And it only happens when I enter the minigame. In the main server my skin‚Äôs fine. So anyway yeah that‚Äôs all.

This is obviously built on that annoying subscription model for premium services. And it‚Äôs not free in the first place. No, I don‚Äôt want to pay extra for a new board or player piece...it‚Äôs just software. Give me a break.Second, there are some pretty bad playability issues. One is initiating trades; the user interface makes it impossible to pick multiple things on the left half of the screen because the player boxes cover the properties. Another is that tapping anywhere near the bottom right when trying to select one of your own properties causes the game to think you tapped the ‚Äúend turn‚Äù button, screwing up your turn. Another horrible gameplay thing is the fact that AI players constantly choose ‚Äúauction‚Äù instead of buying properties outright, which is not at all like how people in real life play the game. Not only that, but the AI player that initiated the auction will bid all the way up to the original cost of the property...why on earth would anyone ever do that? Sloppy gameplay for sure.The older Monopoly game on the App Store, which I purchased long ago, was quite a bit better. This is obviously aimed at milking people for buying new playing boards and player pieces. Pretty gross cash grab.

I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs after that, because it‚Äôs just so much! Even with the rewards they grant, you only get 100 coins which is like nothing. You really have to spend money to play this game. I‚Äôve tried to be patient and play the games out without spending money, but many levels you just can‚Äôt! I don‚Äôt mind spending the money here and there, but it‚Äôs so expensive, it doesn‚Äôt even make it worth it. You get 1000 coins for .99 and it takes 900 coins to get 5 extra turns. That adds up really quick! Plus it‚Äôs even more expensive if you want power ups! I‚Äôm not too sure how much more I can continue playing if they don‚Äôt make some changes. It‚Äôs beginning to add up with how many coins I‚Äôve been buying just to beat rounds. On top of that I believe that there are also sometimes when the board isn‚Äôt applying the power ups correctly.

Maybe that‚Äôs because of the free parking rule. Not sure. 4 if you use up all of the houses so that there aren‚Äôt any more in reserve, and then sell a hotel, more houses Automatically appear.

Chatting with the other users whilst playing out loud could be really great, because you‚Äôd be talking instead of typing through a screen.

That way you could discuss plans with fellow imposters and win in a better and more strategized way. Also you could chat with friends you‚Äôre playing with separately. It would add a better feature of strategy and even betrayal to the game. You could even use it for persuasion purposes.

Oddly, you can exit out, close the app, renter, hit resume game and the frozen character will go again. Unfortunately, after the character moves, once again, frozen. There you are, hopelessly frustrated, finally about to take down Cat, Dog and Ship. Nope, all you can do is start a new game and hope that one doesn‚Äôt freeze. Gave 4/5 cause other than that, it‚Äôs great.","However, this game has one major flaw that makes it entirely not worth buying until fixed.",4,True,effectiveness,negative,2

I played MCPE one time for a couple minutes on a friends tablet almost 6 years ago and I‚Äôve been hooked ever since. I‚Äôve then watched java and bedrock YT videos up until the point when I downloaded PE this April. One thing I did miss about bedrock though was that the ambience noises were removed. I‚Äôm so happy you re-added them with the nether update. I look forward to more updates like the nether update, although not any that are too massive, because people like me (and there are a lot of us) don‚Äôt want to lose the simplicity of Minecraft we grew up with. We all want improvements (bug fixes and Java parity specifically on this version) but we don‚Äôt massive changes that make Minecraft unrecognizable. For example, the cave update everyone wants, every one expects a massive change but don‚Äôt realize it would completely strip Minecraft if it‚Äôs simple mining aspect. I am probably the only person in the world who doesn‚Äôt want a cave update, but I just don‚Äôt want Minecraft to become something else. I‚Äôm sorry this is so long, and I feel bad if any devs actually read this, but I‚Äôve wanted to get this off my chest for a while. Please don‚Äôt strip Minecraft‚Äôs simplicity from it.

There are a few suggestions that I would like to make though. The first suggestion is decreasing the prices for the avatars. I just think they‚Äôre a little bit expensive. Don‚Äôt get me wrong they‚Äôre great characters, but bumping down the price a little wouldn‚Äôt hurt. The second suggestion is offering more discounts on things like coins and prize boxes in the game. Maybe you could even call it Discount Day or Discount Week. The last suggestion is putting more missions in the game. Like for example, having the game players find LIMITED EDITION Gold boxes along the trail, that are filled with SUPER RARE things like unlocking special characters or getting a BIG amount of gems or coins. Other than these few suggestions, this game is amazingly fun! I like how it travels around the world to a new location every other month, and has characters that you buy from that specific location to go along with the theme!

Two really cool characters I would LOVE to have you guys bring back is Mimi and Rabbot. I missed both of them and couldn‚Äôt get a chance to have them as characters. Speaking of Mimi, if I‚Äôm correct she does have a pet otter which is super cute. I don‚Äôt know if the otter runs with her when she is trying to evade the inspector, but if it does I think that the Subway Surfers team should have a pet isle where players can choose an animal to run with them like the inspector has a dog. I would absolutely DIE if that could happen. I also definitely think that younger players would enjoy this. Please consider because I think it will definitely draw more attention to this amazing game. Besides that I think this game has amazing graphics and deserves to have ‚Äúhype‚Äù I also like how you guys make different maps that represent different parts of the world.

You could add past tense, or future tense, or Realistic Minecraft, whatever you want. And possibly, could you eventually add more bosses. Knowing the fact when you beat the Wither and Ender Dragon, there‚Äôs not really anything else to do. Really you could just go to end city, get achievements, that‚Äôs really all that‚Äôs important left. And maybe you could add some guns in the game.

The small mini games shown in the ads are the best part but they are way too few and far between.

Had the earning of coins been much higher, the mini games much more prevalent, the bank either free to obtain or at least an option, the limiting of one star per repair and not having to use stars on anything other than repairs I could have seen playing this longer. I tried these match three types of games several times now and always delete them quickly once the repetition of levels hits. If the match three aspect was a minor part rather than 90% of playing these would be tremendous fun, I‚Äôd even consider paying for that.",The small mini games shown in the ads are the best part but they are way too few and far between.,2,True,efficiency,positive,3

It‚Äôs cute, it‚Äôs colorful and you feel accomplished when you fix the tv or replace the chair. The characters are nice and honestly kind of funny. üòÑ and I‚Äôm glad you guys even included pets in the game! I like how everything is tried to kept decorated around the house. I like Homescapes much better than gradenscapes just because the colors and the graphics are better int my opinion. At least the game is a little better.     The problem is you have to get stars from playing one game only. And even on a hard level you still get 1 star. It‚Äôs annoying how fast your stars run out. What‚Äôs even more annoying, it‚Äôs that sometimes you have to give one of your stars just to open a box, that you‚Äôve already given a star for box to get to the house! What I‚Äôm saying is give more chances to get stars. Like as a prize. Instead of just money, give us a little money and a star! Or have different games besides just the one game to match the colors.     Another thing is that it takes so long to complete one floor or one area of the house because of how limited of the stars you have. So I suppose you should just focus on the star problem because it will fix this one of taking so long! üòÜ     Please take this into consideration.

I thoroughly enjoy the puzzle aspect itself, more so than competing puzzle games. The animations are smoother, the power ups are well thought out and exciting to use, and the puzzles are fun.

As a huge fan of interior design, this seemed like the perfect game for me. I got to play fun levels, but also simultaneously get to decorate a home. However, after spending months on this game, and completing 240 levels, I've only just now unlocked the 3rd room. If you can even call it that. It goes living room, kitchen, and then garden? Why!? There are TONS of rooms in this house, and after TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTY levels, I'm decorating a garden while so much of the house is untouched.

Sometimes the normal levels are harder than the hard ones.

Like, the majority of this game‚Äôs players are under 18 and I don‚Äôt think that people over 13 really need that level of ‚Äúinternet safety‚Äù protection. Second of all with this new quick chat it takes away some of the things that you want to say about who the imposter is and why you are suspicious of them and whatnot. Some things are so unique you just need to put them in your own words. For example the other day I was playing and I saw Orange running away from a dead body.

However, it is far too common for a player to get disconnected or for the game to freeze, ultimately ruining the entire game and leading me to have wasted 2 hours of my time. Also, it is hard to differentiate when a player is simply not paying attention, forgets to roll, or forgets to end their turn so it would be EXTREMELY USEFUL to have a ******chat function****** or at least a button the players could use to notify other players when the game has come to a standstill. I really hope that the monopoly app creators will take these suggestions into account as I have recommended the app to many people and know they have experienced the same frustration as me. Also, it would be awesome if their was a way to pause the game (which I know may actually difficult due to connection issues). Additionally, the game disconnects when someone gets a phone call or even if low battery signal pops up on a players phone. Sometimes the bots will pick up and play for the disconnected user but other times the game is screwed. Regardless, I love how the game is customizable and has great layouts. Love this game, will definitely keep playing, but would profoundly appreciate some improvements given that the Monopoly brand has historically been held with such high regard.","Also, it would be awesome if their was a way to pause the game (which I know may actually difficult due to connection issues).",2,True,enjoyability,positive,4

I walk around and when i pull up the pause menu my custom skin is replaced with a random skin. And I sometimes see other players with my skin equipped. And idk if my skin is working or not. Even when i do the inventory menu my custom skin is still there. So Mojang, if you see this then please reach out to me. My Minecraft account is a Xbox live account named Endermen21YT. So please if you can, look into this. Now this could totally just be the server or something else so this might not even be happening. I‚Äôve even noticed that this has happened to other ppl before on those servers. And it only happens when I enter the minigame. In the main server my skin‚Äôs fine. So anyway yeah that‚Äôs all.

They're pop-up, not videos, so they don't disrupt your game. However, like all games, this one has some problems. My biggest issue is the top run. Every week, the contestants get harder to beat, and eventually you can't get past the last person in the silver because they have over a million. Also, if you get a really good medal, like the diamond, you don't get to keep it for the next week because it changes depending on where you are that week. Another problem is the keys. To revive yourself, you have to pay more and more each time, until it gets so expensive that you can't even afford it. The only way to get keys is in the run, in mystery boxes, or in awards, which is a huge problem because: you only find a key in a run about every eighteen games or so, and if you miss it, then you don't have a chance to get another one. It is extremely rare to get a key in a mystery box, and when you do, it's only one, which can't even begin to pay for the expenses of reviving yourself. It takes a long time to earn a reward, which only gives you three keys, five if you're lucky. So overall, this game is pretty good, but it could use some improvements.","However, like all games, this one has some problems.",4,True,security,negative,9

Why it‚Äôs A annoying. This update makes it hard to type and this so called safe environment is dum. If a player feels like they are getting attacked then they just leave the game and join a new one. If this does not work then they can play with friends or uninstall the game. Another thing is that it feels like you ‚Äú the among us savers ‚Äú are taking away freedom of speech. How?    If someone can‚Äôt say what they want to say about this or that it feels like you censored who that person,thing,or whatever is. However you might say this ‚Äúwell we also have it we‚Äôre if your 18 plus (example for age) you can say what you want to say ‚Äú and your right but but but most people that play this game are under 18 plus as of myself. So these people who have to deal with this new way of ‚Äúspeech‚Äù would most likely not like this but then again I‚Äôm not them.

One of my biggest complaints is the fact that you cannot do something as little as pull down your notification screen a smidge without being forced to bear a 20 second+ dimmed out ‚ÄúRejoining game...‚Äù screen. That‚Äôs ridiculous. Why should it take that long to get back in the game when I hardly even left? The connection errors/bugs are ridiculous and make it rare to get a solid game in. That‚Äôs unacceptable, really. What‚Äôs the point in playing a game that‚Äôs likely to crash because of bugs? Also, the lack of any form of communication between players is upsetting. Seriously, no chat box? No ability to use our microphones? You want to charge $4 for a board game and not let us speak to each other? They‚Äôre also charging $30 for a season pass that I believe features strictly cosmetics. üôÑ Marmalade, if you want our money at least give us a solid game. Another complaint I have is the only games rules we have to choose from are: Classic and Quick mode. It would be nice to have the options to change the rules/play custom games and whatnot. To the Monopoly fans, tread carefully because this game was clearly developed as a cash grab and not to give us the mobile Monopoly we would expect in 2020.

It helps the time go by quickly.  The only thing that bothers me is the hard and extra hard part of the game.  I realize that it breaks up the monotony, but, I spend days sometimes trying to beat the level.  But, it is good that the hard and extra hard are few and far between, so it‚Äôs not overwhelming, it‚Äôs a good change of pace. And, as others have said, rewards are few and far between as well.  Especially with the hard levels, the rewards are just this: your normal level low coin reward is doubled and you are rewarded with one extra star.  I know you have to make money in this venture, but, your doing it to the detriment of your customers.  There is a reason we play games that say that they are free, it‚Äôs because a lot of us do not have the funds to use actual money to progress farther in the game faster then the other players that can afford to use their hard earned money.  In conclusion, I think this game is well worth 5 stars, however, I did only give it 4 stars on account of the hard and very hard levels & the lack of well deserved rewards.  I think there should be better rewards and it should be a little easier to get stars.  Just my opinion for what it‚Äôs worth.

I‚Äôve played many games, but this one has become my favorite. Over time though, I am beginning to get frustrated!

I‚Äôve tried to be patient and play the games out without spending money, but many levels you just can‚Äôt! I don‚Äôt mind spending the money here and there, but it‚Äôs so expensive, it doesn‚Äôt even make it worth it. You get 1000 coins for .99 and it takes 900 coins to get 5 extra turns.

It‚Äôs beginning to add up with how many coins I‚Äôve been buying just to beat rounds. On top of that I believe that there are also sometimes when the board isn‚Äôt applying the power ups correctly.

On another note it would be beneficial to add a friends list feature so you can play with others you meet online as well as people you know in person. Also I‚Äôm not a fan of the chat situation. I feel like an open chat forum would allow for more dexterity in the game.

This is fun, too, but you have to be prepared for some disappointment. Currently, there are bugs that prevent games from being finished, and these bugs can happen after you‚Äôve played for 30 minutes or more. For example, if somebody owes money, and they try to make another deal to raise more money, this seems to stop the game. It seems to lose track of whose turn it is (and who is still owed money). Sometimes, if someone refuses all your deals for that turn, it ends your turn for some reason, but the End Turn button is still shown. Pressing End Turn at this point stops the game. If you are low on battery life and get a battery warning, it can disconnect you from the game. Also, players sometimes stop playing, and there‚Äôs no warning or way to resign without stopping the game for everyone. In spite of these flaws, it‚Äôs a fun game, but there‚Äôs room for improvement.

Before the game would be a little slower than normal, but never THAT slow. I could be casually playing and it would glitch so bad, it would crash! And oddly enough when I try to pause the games it would take over 5 minutes for it to load the menu. Besides that, the gameplay is good, and the graphics are outstanding when you have a good internet connection. The servers are fun to play, and often has a variety of games on the servers. The game updates every once in a while and often features a fun new addition. And the in-game shop has a few free skins, worlds and has deals that are often good. However, when there isn‚Äôt a deal or a promotion for the shop the items can be quite expensive. The items range from 100 coins (0.99) to over 1,000 coins (around $20). Unless you are willing to put in money, you won‚Äôt have the more fun and interactive worlds/skins. TL;DRGood game overall. Has a fun shop with some free stuff and has fun updates.

It‚Äôs a great game to play with friends and family, whether you want to create a massive structure or survive in the wilderness while fighting monsters, or do a bit of both. However, like every game, it does need some improvements. First of all, I suggest that it have a wider variety of animals in the game, (elephants, lions, tigers, sharks, etc). Also, I think their should be more options of furniture, especially in creative mode, rather than having to use steps as chairs. There are also a few glitches that can be annoying. For example, if you add to many mobs in creative, it will lag out your game. Also, there was this one time that I had to delete and reinstall the game because it wouldn‚Äôt let me open up the game.

The sticky situations are called ‚ÄúAustin‚Äôs Bad Dream and in 35 levels, I have only been able to see a few of them.  The game is mostly playing a form of Candy Crush to earn stars in order to improve the home. That part is not so bad. The music is pleasant and the game is a relaxing time waster, at least initially. I don‚Äôt mind using the earned stars to replace furniture or a rug, but as the game goes on, you have to use the stars to do just about anything like answering the door, unpacking a TV, or even starting a new day. And once you‚Äôre out of stars, you can‚Äôt do anything else until you have won more candy crush games and earned more stars. You earn one star from winning each candy crush game no matter how difficult the game is. Win in one round, earn one star. Win after 20 rounds, earn one star.

This is obviously built on that annoying subscription model for premium services. And it‚Äôs not free in the first place. No, I don‚Äôt want to pay extra for a new board or player piece...it‚Äôs just software. Give me a break.Second, there are some pretty bad playability issues. One is initiating trades; the user interface makes it impossible to pick multiple things on the left half of the screen because the player boxes cover the properties. Another is that tapping anywhere near the bottom right when trying to select one of your own properties causes the game to think you tapped the ‚Äúend turn‚Äù button, screwing up your turn. Another horrible gameplay thing is the fact that AI players constantly choose ‚Äúauction‚Äù instead of buying properties outright, which is not at all like how people in real life play the game. Not only that, but the AI player that initiated the auction will bid all the way up to the original cost of the property...why on earth would anyone ever do that? Sloppy gameplay for sure.The older Monopoly game on the App Store, which I purchased long ago, was quite a bit better. This is obviously aimed at milking people for buying new playing boards and player pieces. Pretty gross cash grab.

The problem is you have to get stars from playing one game only. And even on a hard level you still get 1 star. It‚Äôs annoying how fast your stars run out. What‚Äôs even more annoying, it‚Äôs that sometimes you have to give one of your stars just to open a box, that you‚Äôve already given a star for box to get to the house! What I‚Äôm saying is give more chances to get stars. Like as a prize. Instead of just money, give us a little money and a star! Or have different games besides just the one game to match the colors.     Another thing is that it takes so long to complete one floor or one area of the house because of how limited of the stars you have.

Real players wouldn‚Äôt do half of this stuff   Sometimes it appears that the dice roll is not random.  Sometimes the chance or community chest cards can be the same thing on back to back draws. Who goes first, second, third is flawed because it depends upon how you are listed and who rolls the highest dice when playing against the A.I players.   Not as much animation is needed which may help the battery drain or at least give an option to turn some of that off. So many things in each turn slow the whole game down and could be altered to keep it moving. Why not put the property cards displaying in the lower right rather than taking up the whole screen.

If I earn the minimum coins per level (50) and play 10 levels, it still isn‚Äôt enough to get a retry on a particularly hard level. Now I do think the fact they are called ‚ÄúHard Levels‚Äù makes it better for us to prepare, and definitely the coin amount there is worth it. But in order to pass a level, I spend almost 6-8 hearts if it‚Äôs extremely time-consuming and hard. There is still the issue with more prizes. I like the daily bonus, but after the seventh day, it sent me right back to the first day without any prizes. I believe it should be after the 7th day, you get all the prizes from day 1-6 at the same time, and then day 8 and on should have more until you reach every seventh day again. It‚Äôs a good way to make people play the game. There also need to be more tournaments that don‚Äôt give prizes based off places.

I'm on level 454 and have only renovated the butlers room, great room, kitchen, and stairs! Maybe the creators of the game could give players a choice on which room or area to continue with? Otherwise, I love the gameplay. Just stick to the idea of home renovation instead of branching to other story lines for so long. Don't mind it for a few levels, but veers off way too long.","Just when I thought I was finished in the garden, the story line STILL has more garden tasks.",5,True,enjoyability,negative,4

Each update is better then the last, adding amazing animals and new objects. However I have noticed in the recent update, TONS of new bugs and issues have occurred.

I end having to close the app and reopen it. Another problem that has recently developed is, whenever I go into chat when I am on a sever, my game immediately freezes, then crashes and knocks me out of the app. Another thing that has recently happened is when I am playing and go into my inventory, it freezes and won‚Äôt unfreeze. One more is, sometimes when I go into the nether, it stays frozen on the ‚Äúloading terrain‚Äù screen. Other than these glitches and bugs, I HIGHLY recommend this game.

What I‚Äôm saying is give more chances to get stars. Like as a prize. Instead of just money, give us a little money and a star! Or have different games besides just the one game to match the colors.     Another thing is that it takes so long to complete one floor or one area of the house because of how limited of the stars you have.

I‚Äôve tried to be patient and play the games out without spending money, but many levels you just can‚Äôt! I don‚Äôt mind spending the money here and there, but it‚Äôs so expensive, it doesn‚Äôt even make it worth it. You get 1000 coins for .99 and it takes 900 coins to get 5 extra turns. That adds up really quick! Plus it‚Äôs even more expensive if you want power ups! I‚Äôm not too sure how much more I can continue playing if they don‚Äôt make some changes. It‚Äôs beginning to add up with how many coins I‚Äôve been buying just to beat rounds. On top of that I believe that there are also sometimes when the board isn‚Äôt applying the power ups correctly. It's almost like a glitch or something that‚Äôs not working. I‚Äôm really hoping they make some changes to this game!

I find them to be fun and even addicting. Although the concept of the game is great, and I‚Äôve only been playing for a short while, something needs to be improved with the coin/lives system. Getting around 50 coins per mini-game, which can take multiple lives to complete, isn‚Äôt sufficient enough. In order to buy a life, 900 coins, you would have to play around 18 rounds just to get enough coins for ONE life. I do not pay money on games, never have never will, but it‚Äôs so frustrating that you may have one move left and instead of paying real cash, not in game coins, you have to wait for a life to replenish just to try and fail at the level again. Each round can take 10+ lives to complete, and it takes quite awhile for the lives to replenish. There should be some kind of reward opportunity other than completing a day, especially because you need to play the mini-games to get stars, in order to complete tasks, to complete the day. That‚Äôs a lot of tasks to do with not a lot of lives/coin rewards!!! If there were events where you can play other mini-games to gain rewards/treasures I think it would be more efficient. I also think 28 minutes is a long time to wait for one single life. I don‚Äôt want to give up on this game with not a lot of time put into it already, but if there is no improvement, I might have to.","In order to buy a life, 900 coins, you would have to play around 18 rounds just to get enough coins for ONE life.",3,True,cost,negative,1

A second thing I would love to see added is a currency like coins or maybe something more creative like aliens. Then, players should receive say, 5 aliens or coins if they win as a crew mate and 10 aliens or coins if they win as imposter. Then, I think players should be able to use these coins/aliens to buy hats or outfits. I also think it would be really cool if we could use this currency to buy higher imposter chances because I would love if I could do that. The third and final thing I would love to see added is a report button. This would be good because I have noticed that some people say weird or disturbing things in my games quite often.

Minecraft just got boring because there were no other items that are really decorative, like when you want to build a house, you needed a toilet. But there is no toilet in Minecraft. Mods like Decocraft mod and Bibliocraft mod have many other items that are decorative for a house, but sadly there are no mods for Minecraft PE. What I mean by this is that mods don't work on Minecraft PE. There are only Addons, but really Addons just REPLACE other items. Please add more items like toilets or TVs and more in Minecraft!

I see that they were trying to fix the problem of swearing and online dating but it just wasn‚Äôt the right way to fix the problem. The game used to be so enjoyable, and now I probably won‚Äôt be playing it again. There are many other ways to fix this problem, but restricting what people can type so that they can‚Äôt get their point across is not the way to do it.

To be honest you ruined your own game. The bulk of people that play are teens and now we have no freedom. We get all of these restrictions everywhere and you had to add among to that list. I‚Äôm very disappointed. If you could lower the age for safe chat from 18 to 13 that would be great. 18 is very unrealistic compared to 13 which is much more reasonable. Also look at all of the reviews your getting. People aren‚Äôt happy and your star level is dropping. I‚Äôll let that speak for itself. Just change the game back or tweak the update please.

Maybe if you let people type in some things but not everything like ‚Äòyou are an idiot!‚Äô that would be double awesome!!

Played it for hours and just recently bought the 950k character, but the graphics recently changed and look more like graphics found in a game made 5 or 6 years ago. I wish the creators would go back to the graphics that were in use even a month ago but I understand if the developers no longer have enough downloads or are generating enough revenue for the better graphics, but I also wanted to make it common knowledge that the game has changed, in my opinion, for the worse. Again love the game, not a fan of the new (or old?) graphics. In order to make it better it would be great if the graphics on the jet pack had less exhaust‚Äîthe moving from side to side with a long trail of exhaust moving as the character does makes it look old, cheesy, and cheap. The way the character moves under tunnels also looks odd‚Äîit would be better to keep the POV of the gamer in one position as the character moves under the tunnel instead of bringing the overall view under the tunnel as well.",Trust me: I love this game.,4,True,enjoyability,positive,4

Board games in reality are fixed in many ways. For example, a deck of cards with a discard pile ensured that every card in the game will be played before a player can draw a second copy of any card. This also ensures equal odds of getting a card. This app takes the simpler approach of randomly generating the card on each draw. This means you may draw cards like ‚ÄúSpeeding Fine‚Äù two or three times in a row, while never pulling ‚ÄúAdvance To...‚Äù cards of any kind. The odds of card drawing seem to also favor the weaker cards. The developers assure that‚Äôs not true, but an easy way to restore faith would be to have the cards work with an actual deck and discard system instead of random generation upon each draw. To me, the purpose of this is to mimic the board game, if you wanted to change the fundamentals of the game then a different game mode would be nice. A ‚ÄúRandomized‚Äù mode could be fun along with the original two, but I would want the ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù mode to run like the classic board game. Otherwise, the game is functionally okay.

The only reason why because we have to fix the house. I don‚Äôt know why else. But it can also be dived into sections of the game. This is what a like so much. This app appears to be too similar to Candy Crush. But it has different things to do. And this is also having similar power ups. One more thing before closing the review. 900 coins is a lot for 5 moves. I think you need 1/3 of the amount (300 coins) and save 900 coins for 5 more moves and another thing. Overall it is a good game. I hope you have a wonderful update very soon. Great game 5/5 stars.",The only way is that we did our skills.,5,True,general,positive,5

For example, every task around the house goes from costing one star to two. The rewards aren‚Äôt sufficient to the amount of boosts being spent on harder levels. Some levels are so hard and waste so many lives that you have to use boosts just to get through it. There should be more levels that don‚Äôt take multiple tries to get through. Some of the tasks that the game makes you do are stupid. The game is trying to get you to use all your stars so you have to play more, which is typical, but with the levels so hard, it‚Äôs really just a tactic to get people to spend more money. It‚Äôs also takes way too long for the lives to reload. It‚Äôs like 25mins per life. I really liked this game at the start but the further I‚Äôve gotten, the less I want to continue playing. Instead of throwing in so many different aspects into the puzzle games so soon, they should have waited and made it harder much later. I‚Äôm only in the kitchen and I spend on average 3-5 lives on each level. I try not to use boosters because they are so hard to earn. Paying 900coins to get 5 more moves on one level, when each level earns you roughly 50-70 coins (hard levels earn you 100+) is just sad. In conclusion, this game only remains fun for the first 60 levels then gets frustrating.

Also would it be possible if someone were to leave the game could you guys maybe notify that and then put a CPU into the game and notifying that a CPU has been added so there‚Äôs no waited time to see if the game frozen it‚Äôs been plenty of times where the game is getting really good and suddenly it freezes it just breaks the point of online and makes me want to play with CPU instead cause it‚Äôs less time consuming not having to wait on either the game or other people.

Also when you get into the game more, it takes so much longer to finish a day, it‚Äôll be like 6% closer to rewards when you win a level. Also I don‚Äôt like how we only have five lives. I feel like we should have more lives than only 5! The game‚Äôs really fun but there is some stupidity to it like tasks cost so much, but u only get one star for each level, and for every normal level, 50 coins. But if you want more moves after you use them all up, it costs 900 coins. I think that is way too expensive. And I hate how long it takes for lives to refill! Like, 30 minutes to wait for one live! Also, for the harder levels, I think that we should get more stars, not only one!! I think that if they‚Äôre going to go all the way and say that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúsuper hard level‚Äù then they should act like it and give more stars once the level is completed!!

It can drop up to 3 bones when killed, it doesn‚Äôt attack you unless if you attack it first,  (just like when you hit a wolf in survival when it isn‚Äôt tamed to anyone in that world) it deals three hearts when it attacks you, and it has a body made of bones with no eyes. 2. Black Bear. A bear with a brown snout, brown belly, and all the rest is black fur. It can only be found in Taiga (spruce forest) biomes. It has the same body that the polar bear does. It eats raw fish of any type and sweet berries, but you cannot tame them, you can only breed them (just like the foxes). They can spawn when the world is in peaceful, easy, normal, or hard. But when it is peaceful, when you attack them they won‚Äôt attack you back. But when it isn‚Äôt in peaceful when you attack one, they deal 4 hearts when the player is in survival. 3. Penguin.

I never really thought about life that deep before, when I was still very young, but now that a few years have passed, I definitely have developed a drastically deeper understanding for Minecraft.

I deleted it after reaching level 20. The reason I deleted it is because it‚Äôs too boring to me. It was interesting fixing up the house but having to use multiple stars for some aspects and even to move to the next day is greedy. The bank I despised. Good premise but it holds coins you earn hostage unless you pay to buy it once you accumulate 3000 or 5000 coins. There is no choice either, you watch your coins disappear. The small mini games shown in the ads are the best part but they are way too few and far between. The majority of this game is playing levels over and over trying to get the next star to fix the never ending repairs. I also found having to use stars to open packages annoying. If I‚Äôm getting a gift it should be just. There is some humor and the scenes are colorful which is why i gave it two stars. Had the earning of coins been much higher, the mini games much more prevalent, the bank either free to obtain or at least an option, the limiting of one star per repair and not having to use stars on anything other than repairs I could have seen playing this longer. I tried these match three types of games several times now and always delete them quickly once the repetition of levels hits.

It always makes road trips boring for me if I want to play minecraft with a friend. Also, if you guys could make it where people can share a wolf. My first wolf from the beginning passed away tonight due to a skeleton attack. Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone‚Äôs been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful. Also if you could make it where villagers, foxes, and mobs can be leashed. That‚Äôs all my requests for now.

However, the game is hard to play on my own time. The game really only works when it wants to. Some are do to bugs, and some are due to just poor design. 1) Game will not load when you go offline still logged into Xbox. It will not let you sign out, and the game crashes repeatedly. I have not found a way to fix this, because even when I try to enable cellular data, it still will not load because no changes in settings are saved before the game crashes. This is extremely inconvenient when I just want to play single player offline. This bug has been going on for months and is consistently overlooked. Please fix this immediately. It discourages players from even attempting to load up their worlds, which ultimately hurts the developers.2) Background music stops when Minecraft is launched. If you are listening to Spotify/Pandora, etc, then the game automatically cuts off your music when you listen to the game. If people didn‚Äôt pause their music before entering the game, then obviously, they want to listen to it while the play! This was definitely programmed in, for reasons I can‚Äôt even begin to comprehend.

There were a few more parts that didn‚Äôt need to be there, but they put them there. Like when Austin‚Äôs dad stomps on the floor and breaks it, he they didn‚Äôt have to do that. Austin would have repaired it anyway. I am also confused about when Austin got to the house and went into his room and instead of a bed, there was a couch. Where did he sleep?

No big deal, it‚Äôs something that can happen sometimes and I can just join right back in. But after 5 minutes it did it again. Then again. And again. Keep in mind I was sitting right next to my router and had all my bars and yet the game kept booting me from the server. I bounced the internet twice and still came out with the same results. Sometimes I would close the entire game and reopen it only to find that the world wouldn‚Äôt even pop up. We were stuck in this complicated dance for over an hour before we decided to call it quits out of utter frustration. There is no way this could just be my internet. Not only was I mere inches away from the router but I was the only one in my house. Nobody else was connected to the internet but me so why did I keep getting booted out of the server?

I also feel like since people can lie about their age, and it isn‚Äôt fair to us as kids to let older people be able to say what they want when it seems like they do the most cursing, maybe people can report others that cuss so they would have to use the quick chat for a month or so, since another problem is that it only stops the kids from cursing and explicit stuff, they can still see what other people do if they don‚Äôt have censor chat on. As a result of this, in addition to the above suggestion, make it so that the quick chat is an option available, not an unfamiliar thing forced upon us kids.

Now, after updating the game from not playing it for over a year, the game lags for seemingly no reason (it runs smoother with the internet turned off and turning off multiplayer seems to make little difference). Some sounds are still present in the game but some sounds don't play at all such as picking up blocks or when you get hurt or die. Enemies do not make unique sounds when hit and has a seemingly stock sound effect playing. I have not had problem with infinite maps before; however, I now have problems with all maps. The game only feels playable when all high end settings are disabled, mob spawning is disabled, and setting gameplay to peaceful. In addition, the UI is not touch screen friendly like it was in the alpha and beta.

But ever since Character Creator has been added to the game, my custom skins have been looking off. I use slim-armed skins because I prefer them over classic skins but the glitch only occurs on slim-armed skins. Let‚Äôs say you have a slim-armed skin, and you wanted a unique design on each leg. Like different-lengthened socks, or a flower on one and a star on the other. Then when you upload the skin on the game, whatever way you designed the right leg (it looks like the left leg if you look straight at the skin) gets copy and pasted automatically onto the left leg (right leg if you look at the skin straight at the face). It looks distorted, as I don‚Äôt know if other players can or cannot see the error besides yourself, but it‚Äôs basically both legs are symmetrical while a lot of skin designers like not making symmetrical, and the second layer on the leg that gets changed to looking like the other stays. So basically the glitched leg looks exactly like the other leg that looks perfectly fine, but has second layer on it. Like then both legs would have like a flower on it but the star‚Äôs second layer is stuck on top of the copy and pasted flower. Pretty odd right? For me it makes me feel like I have OCD, I can‚Äôt stand skins that have something off on it, sorry. It doesn‚Äôt do the glitch on classic skins though.

However, the game is hard to play on my own time. The game really only works when it wants to. Some are do to bugs, and some are due to just poor design. 1) Game will not load when you go offline still logged into Xbox. It will not let you sign out, and the game crashes repeatedly. I have not found a way to fix this, because even when I try to enable cellular data, it still will not load because no changes in settings are saved before the game crashes. This is extremely inconvenient when I just want to play single player offline. This bug has been going on for months and is consistently overlooked. Please fix this immediately. It discourages players from even attempting to load up their worlds, which ultimately hurts the developers.2) Background music stops when Minecraft is launched. If you are listening to Spotify/Pandora, etc, then the game automatically cuts off your music when you listen to the game. If people didn‚Äôt pause their music before entering the game, then obviously, they want to listen to it while the play!

I had downloaded the Harry Potter, Marvel bundle and Star Wars decks onto my phone with the reasonable expectation that my wife, son and daughter would be able to use them as well.  It is understandable that Ellen DeGeneres would want to make money, but it is terribly petty and unbecoming to be this greedy.

Second of all with this new quick chat it takes away some of the things that you want to say about who the imposter is and why you are suspicious of them and whatnot.

The animation is lovely, the load times are quick, and, of course, Monopoly is just fun to play. My only quibble is the programming of the computer players. As far as I can tell, the only differences between the easy and hard modes are the likelihood that the computer players will elect not to buy a property or make a bizarre trade. I find that the game is artificially difficult at times because the computer players frequently make unreasonable trades that savvy human players would never make. For example, Dog will make a trade with Penguin that gives Penguin an orange monopoly (at a time when Penguin has tons of money and can immediately build it up to four houses per property). In exchange, Dog got a second red property that Dog can‚Äôt do anything with (because I have the third red property). So Dog gives Penguin an almost insurmountable advantage early in the game for no obvious strategic reason.

I thoroughly enjoy the puzzle aspect itself, more so than competing puzzle games. The animations are smoother, the power ups are well thought out and exciting to use, and the puzzles are fun. I'm docking points though, because the storylines are infuriating to deal with. What roped me in to downloading this game was the home decor aspect. As a huge fan of interior design, this seemed like the perfect game for me. I got to play fun levels, but also simultaneously get to decorate a home. However, after spending months on this game, and completing 240 levels, I've only just now unlocked the 3rd room. If you can even call it that. It goes living room, kitchen, and then garden? Why!? There are TONS of rooms in this house, and after TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTY levels, I'm decorating a garden while so much of the house is untouched. Don't even get me started on the baking storyline. 6 stars just to bake the cake base. Another 3 to bake the house cake. Another 3 to frost it. Another 3 to put it together. Then 2 to drive it to the studio. Then 2 to celebrate the win. Then another 2 to open a present for winning... it doesn't stop! I didn't download the game to bake a cake. I downloaded it to furnish a house! Stop with that nonsense. It took WEEKS to get through that ridiculous storyline.

So basically the glitched leg looks exactly like the other leg that looks perfectly fine, but has second layer on it. Like then both legs would have like a flower on it but the star‚Äôs second layer is stuck on top of the copy and pasted flower. Pretty odd right?

And when i go into one the minigames, that minigame being High-School Roleplay there are problems with my custom skin. So idk if this has to do with the server but this has happened most of the time. I walk around and when i pull up the pause menu my custom skin is replaced with a random skin. And I sometimes see other players with my skin equipped. And idk if my skin is working or not. Even when i do the inventory menu my custom skin is still there. So Mojang, if you see this then please reach out to me. My Minecraft account is a Xbox live account named Endermen21YT. So please if you can, look into this. Now this could totally just be the server or something else so this might not even be happening. I‚Äôve even noticed that this has happened to other ppl before on those servers. And it only happens when I enter the minigame. In the main server my skin‚Äôs fine. So anyway yeah that‚Äôs all. I personally still love this game to freaking pieces so keep up the good work Mojang.",So basically I play on the server: MineVille City.,5,True,security,positive,9

But when you have 10 more moves left and you win the level you are lucky to win 58 coins?!?!  And you just better break out your dollars because some levels you will be killing yourselves to win. Like 498 level I am not going to spend anymore money on this game. And the few moves it gives you to play and the purple blocks that has the bugs in them good luck they get much harder in higher up levels. This level it has the regular white blocks that grow but the purple ones you have to kit them 2 to 3 times and they grow back just one to two moves after you remove another side. To get extra coins for more lives or boosters it is a lot of money for what little you get. 900 coins you get 3 this. And 1900 coins you get 3 globes. The lives run out so fast and sometimes my friends send me lives I see them and play one game go back to collect the life because it won‚Äôt allow you to have 6 life‚Äôs and it is missing. I am in the room right at the stairs I forget what it is called. Looks like another living room to me. The outside green house it felt like it took years to finish the plot line. I wish you could request the boosters but place them where you want them if you want them in the game. Like they would be added to your side menu but not dropped down in the puzzle because it places them and there would be a awesome move but the boosters messed it up and you only can use the boosters there is no other move.,To get extra coins for more lives or boosters it is a lot of money for what little you get.,2,True,cost,negative,1

It is very entertaining and sometimes I spend hours in a day playing it. The levels seem to get really difficult after you start renovating the third room. I really find it so frustrating that we have to wait 30 minutes for each life to come back. Also, the amount of moves given in each level is ridiculous. Sometimes, you need just 2 more moves to pass the level and you can‚Äôt because you‚Äôre out of moves. Then, if you want more, you have to pay 900 coins for only five more moves. And if you don‚Äôt have the money, you have to forfeit and loose the game. Other times, you can join competitions and get really cool power ups. If I get stuck on one of the levels in the challenges, I loose all my prizes and earned money. The point of the game is to be fun and decorate a house, which honestly is my favorite part of the game. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the matching part of the game is so fun too, I just hate the fact that you have to wait so long to get lives and some of the tasks they ask you to do are just ridiculous.

Board games in reality are fixed in many ways. For example, a deck of cards with a discard pile ensured that every card in the game will be played before a player can draw a second copy of any card. This also ensures equal odds of getting a card. This app takes the simpler approach of randomly generating the card on each draw. This means you may draw cards like ‚ÄúSpeeding Fine‚Äù two or three times in a row, while never pulling ‚ÄúAdvance To...‚Äù cards of any kind. The odds of card drawing seem to also favor the weaker cards. The developers assure that‚Äôs not true, but an easy way to restore faith would be to have the cards work with an actual deck and discard system instead of random generation upon each draw. To me, the purpose of this is to mimic the board game, if you wanted to change the fundamentals of the game then a different game mode would be nice. A ‚ÄúRandomized‚Äù mode could be fun along with the original two, but I would want the ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù mode to run like the classic board game. Otherwise, the game is functionally okay.

First was ads that would play after clicking on the home icon. I don‚Äôt mind ads that I choose to watch because I want to double my reward, but I don‚Äôt want to see ads when moving from one screen to the next. The most recent major annoyance is the red exclamation point on the Shop button. After I click the daily reward and the offers, the red exclamation point still remains. What the heck?!? I don‚Äôt want to keep seeing it. Yes, I know there are special offers, and the daily reward is ready, but what else? The third annoyance is ads within ads. What is this new type of purgatory? I see a screen playing a different ad within the ad that‚Äôs playing. And the last annoyance (for now, anyway) is that the sound is not always off even when the phone is on silent. What if I were in an important board meeting and surreptitiously playing Subway Surfers and the sound for the ad bursts out? If I silence the game, I expect the ads to be silenced as well. I‚Äôll rate Subway Surfers as 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è if the ad issues are solved, because the game play and reward system is great.","I‚Äôll rate Subway Surfers as 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è if the ad issues are solved, because the game play and reward system is great.",4,True,efficiency,positive,3

I love how you get to visit new locations (BTW I‚Äôve been to Amsterdam so it was fun to see it in the game.), get cool characters, and enjoy running in the subway.I personally think that the graphics are great. They don‚Äôt have to be perfect, as you can still play the game without problems. I have tried programming before and it IS NOT EASY. I would like to give a shoutout to whoever made this game because it is fabulous, no matter what others say.I do think that the characters are a little over priced, but that is just me. I do like how there are lots of ways to earn the money for them. (Play the game itself, watch adds, get mystery boxes, ETC.)Maybe you could add a feature where you could sign in with another account. I get that you don‚Äôt need an account to play (And that is great!) but my favorite character, Tagbot, is on my other device. I remember him being very expensive and I would love a way to sign into that account on another device so I could get Tagbot back.Thank you for reading this review. I can tell that this game was planned out and worked hard on. Great job!!!","), get cool characters, and enjoy running in the subway.",5,True,enjoyability,positive,4

I first saw it played on Twitch and said I have got to experience this. The graphics, animation and modeling are really fun. Based on old reviews, I think many issues from the past are solved. The network seems reliable and the rules and variations are pretty much on point. The AI players add a new dimension. They are annoying at worst and a wonderful addition for shrewd dealing humans, at best. The klunky repetitious and nonsensical ‚Äúoffers‚Äù they make are pretty bad. And the fact that they only assess deals based on value of the deeds and classifying them as ‚Äúeasy, medium, or hard‚Äù just improves their luck and reduces yours makes them pretty frustrating at times. But they‚Äôre fun to push around and like I said, they create a whole new dimension in game play. Imagine making a deal with a predictable robot to mess up your human opponent, etc. That said, the overall game feels cold and lonely. How do we know we are really playing against a human when we join Multiplayer online? What is our own record of wins and losses? What if we want to play against a particular player again? Marmalade and Hasbro are doing a pretty nice job getting all their games online. But these old parlor games deserve at least a minimal social component to keep people returning.

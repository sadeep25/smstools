I like the colors and the modern feel of moving environments makes extended play time feel flowy and not stagnant. The peices  are fine I just used to enjoy the Car actually driving and the Ship actually sailing so it‚Äôs like game is modernized in all the wrong places. Above all else the game play is so very unfair. It rolls you exactly what you don‚Äôt need EVERY TIME.

It keeps kicking me out before I even get a chance to play a game. For instance, I was playing with a bunch of my friends on a call, and right when the game started, it kicked me out and I didn‚Äôt get to play. But luckily, I have it on my computer and I still got to play, but not for a couple of rounds. Maybe it‚Äôs just my phone, but maybe not. 2. We need friends in the game. Let me explain. If you play like 5 games in a row with someone and you‚Äôre bonding with them, maybe you have to go or maybe they have to go, or if you get kicked or something, you never get to see each other ever again. Also it could be the same thing except with friends. And maybe you can see if you‚Äôre friends (in the game) are playing. 3. Newer stuff, like new colors, tasks and hats would be absolutely amazing! I have seen that the developers are working on a new map. 1 question about that. Is it gonna be a hide and seek map? If so that would be the most wonderful thing! Or even just another map even if the one you‚Äôre working on isn‚Äôt a hide and seek one. I love Among Us and all its features. I very much respect everyone that works on it, and I know it‚Äôs hard.

The concept and game idea itself is why people enjoy playing so much. The game allows you to work to deceive and lie to people in a way that is totally expectable socially because it‚Äôs all for sun and games. It‚Äôs the same game over and over and over again yet you still have people returning to play more which really says something about how great it is. I could play like 20 games in a row and never get bored. A lot of people feel this same way which is probably why the game is so successful and although that‚Äôs good, it comes with a price. That price is more content. People need more and more content and if the demand isn‚Äôt met with even small additions like new tasks or new colors for characters then the game will slowly start to die out. A big thing people want is the ability to have friends. You can play like 40 games with the same person and really bond with them and get to know them, only for both of you to be kicked out of the game for an update or hacking or something and you‚Äôd never be able to see them again. A friend request feature would go a long way to helping this issue, plus with more friends you can play with, the more people will want to play.All in all this is the best game in the App Store right now 10/10, 100%, 5 stars, it‚Äôs just great.",I could play like 20 games in a row and never get bored.,5,True,enjoyability,positive,4

I often keep my tablet in monochrome setting and for the most part this doesn‚Äôt inhibit game play as the shapes are so different. However the ice bombs are all the same shape and in grayscale I cannot tell them apart as they are too close in tone to their one another and not identical in tone to the matching shape. It is frustrating.On a completely different note. I am convinced Austin is dead and this whole game is an afterlife experience. Otherwise the back story of him as a butler (second generation no less) whose family as this fabulous history and mansion makes very little sense. The butler conceit causes other problems as well. I HATE having to spend stars to sweep or dust when Austin sweeps to ‚Äúalienate boredom,‚Äù and often enough to warrant concerns about it being an obsessive behavior... maybe he isn‚Äôt dead, maybe his parents sent him to a special program for individuals with extreme obsessive behavior, the Institute wasn‚Äôt a school for butlers, it was an institution for individuals with special needs such as delusional thinking and obsessive behavior.",I often keep my tablet in monochrome setting and for the most part this doesn‚Äôt inhibit game play as the shapes are so different.,4,True,general,positive,5

If you had to pay upfront for this game, I‚Äôm pretty sure there would be grounds for a lawsuit; it‚Äôs THAT bad. What this game is centered on is the much more generic Candy Crush, ‚Äúmatch the tiles‚Äù type gameplay. The reason I don‚Äôt give it a 1-star is because they have actually made this generic premise fun, and put some admirable twists into the formula (at least I think. I don‚Äôt play many mobile games and especially match tile types). Interesting challenges, creative power-ups you can make if you‚Äôre smart, genuinely challenging puzzles (in a fun way), admirable special effects & sound design. Doesn‚Äôt SEEM to try to force its way into your wallet (from the 12hrs I‚Äôve put into the game thus far) in terms of gameplay, but it does do plenty of in-game marketing.If this game was honest about what it really was, I‚Äôd give it 4-stars.

It‚Äôs fun, entertaining, and creative. But the LAG. Recently, a few days ago, when playing with my friend in a world, it kept kicking me out of the app, disconnecting me, yet I have full bars of internet. One time, when I was sleeping, it kicked me out. When I went back into the world, it kept me in the sleeping mode. However, whenever I put leave bed, it would kick me out of the app. Some side effects were my avatar got glitchy and laggy. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs my device or not, but I cannot talk about it. Secondly, I would like if we can build all the materials except the blocks, (nether blocks, etc.). I hate that every time I see a horse, I have to change cheats on and change to creative to get a saddle.I would also like if we could make realistic things like tables, plates to put in our food in, chairs, etc. Although minor, it would still be a great update if it was actual c: Edit: I just dropped it down to 1 star, maybe even deserves zero for how much I disconnect and lag. It‚Äôs frustrating having to get kicked out, join back in, and it not being saved. I get kicked out every 5-10 min. Each time I turn off my wifi.

However, it is far too common for a player to get disconnected or for the game to freeze, ultimately ruining the entire game and leading me to have wasted 2 hours of my time. Also, it is hard to differentiate when a player is simply not paying attention, forgets to roll, or forgets to end their turn so it would be EXTREMELY USEFUL to have a ******chat function****** or at least a button the players could use to notify other players when the game has come to a standstill. I really hope that the monopoly app creators will take these suggestions into account as I have recommended the app to many people and know they have experienced the same frustration as me. Also, it would be awesome if their was a way to pause the game (which I know may actually difficult due to connection issues). Additionally, the game disconnects when someone gets a phone call or even if low battery signal pops up on a players phone. Sometimes the bots will pick up and play for the disconnected user but other times the game is screwed. Regardless, I love how the game is customizable and has great layouts. Love this game, will definitely keep playing, but would profoundly appreciate some improvements given that the Monopoly brand has historically been held with such high regard.","Regardless, I love how the game is customizable and has great layouts.",2,True,aesthetics,positive,0

It is very entertaining and sometimes I spend hours in a day playing it. The levels seem to get really difficult after you start renovating the third room. I really find it so frustrating that we have to wait 30 minutes for each life to come back. Also, the amount of moves given in each level is ridiculous. Sometimes, you need just 2 more moves to pass the level and you can‚Äôt because you‚Äôre out of moves. Then, if you want more, you have to pay 900 coins for only five more moves. And if you don‚Äôt have the money, you have to forfeit and loose the game. Other times, you can join competitions and get really cool power ups. If I get stuck on one of the levels in the challenges, I loose all my prizes and earned money. The point of the game is to be fun and decorate a house, which honestly is my favorite part of the game. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the matching part of the game is so fun too, I just hate the fact that you have to wait so long to get lives and some of the tasks they ask you to do are just ridiculous. As an example, if I got a cat in the game, it says I need to give a star just to name it. I mean that‚Äôs ridiculous.

With the old game, if I played 20 games, I could strategize and win about half of them. With this new version, I‚Äôve won only once in 20 games! And that‚Äôs only because I refused to trade. The AI consistently ends up with more funds from giveaways and pays less taxes while the human pays more taxes and gets fewer random giveaways. Please rework the AI algorithm to make it a more enjoyable and better balanced game!!Reply to developer: I never accused the game of being ‚Äúrigged.‚Äù As any programmer knows, there is no such thing as ‚Äúrandom.‚Äù Programming any software takes human choice. My point was that the programming of the old version of Monopoly was more balanced than the present version, and as such, the present app needs to be reworked to be better balanced and more enjoyable to play.For version 1.3: the background (city) sounds are much too loud now! Can barely hear the sound of the board anymore. It‚Äôs the sound of the dice and playing pieces on the board that bring it alive for me. Please lower the city sounds back to where they were.

More mods are being used and hacking and cheating is getting more popular. Some times, I can‚Äôt play one game without a hacker or cheater. Multiple people play together and say who is the imposter and some hackers are being able to kill in the middle of meetings and do visuals as imposter. Another reason is that there are no new maps. Among us said that the new airship would come out in early December 2020, but they delayed it and said early 2021. Everyone thought it would come out in January or February, but it‚Äôs March and it still hasn‚Äôt come out yet. Another reason is that the new chat update can‚Äôt let you talk freely. Now you spend all of  your meeting time searching around for the prewritten text that you want to say. Another reason is the horrible connection. Some times, I have to spend like 20 minutes trying to connect my game. People say it‚Äôs my bad wifi, but that‚Äôs not true because my wifi works perfectly fine.

Like your in a chat and you want to be friends with someone, you can tap there person a new it can be like a profile type thing and you can chat personally and invite them into games. Can you also make it to where you can keep passed games you made. Like say you hosted a game and you like the people in the game, can you make it to where you can have like a place where all your passed games where at and keep it there. Can you also maybe make it where you can favorite lobby. Like there can be a button like a heart or something and you can go to like a tab and go to your favorite lobby‚Äôs. Do you also think you can it where when you die you can a have an overview of the whole map. But only when you die so it‚Äôs fair. Do you also think you can make something called ‚Äúwatch mode‚Äù when you can watch other people play games and you can be I there body‚Äôs and watch as they play and overview the map.

It can drop up to 3 bones when killed, it doesn‚Äôt attack you unless if you attack it first,  (just like when you hit a wolf in survival when it isn‚Äôt tamed to anyone in that world) it deals three hearts when it attacks you, and it has a body made of bones with no eyes. 2. Black Bear. A bear with a brown snout, brown belly, and all the rest is black fur. It can only be found in Taiga (spruce forest) biomes. It has the same body that the polar bear does. It eats raw fish of any type and sweet berries, but you cannot tame them, you can only breed them (just like the foxes). They can spawn when the world is in peaceful, easy, normal, or hard. But when it is peaceful, when you attack them they won‚Äôt attack you back. But when it isn‚Äôt in peaceful when you attack one, they deal 4 hearts when the player is in survival. 3. Penguin. It only spawns in snowy plains and on icebergs. They eat raw fish of any type, but you cannot tame them, you can only breed them. They have a white belly and the rest is all-black.

As u rank up the more stars  u need to complete ONE task it‚Äôs not fair. Also I downloaded the game mainly to be able to redecorate the house and once you finish the kitchen you get sent outside to build the garden/ greenhouse. It is the most boring part of the game that takes FOREVER to finish. You can finish a room in 1-3 days of completion. But the outside has taken 6+ days to work on and I finally just gave up because of how many unnecessary tasks you have to complete just to get through one day. Every time u think your finally done with the outside theirs something stupid you have to still do. This game is only fun for a few days after that it‚Äôll just make you want to throw your phone in the garbage. Also the amount of coins you get for each level is unbelievable you should be able to get more the higher you level up but nope they just want you to try to buy their packages.

It‚Äôs so fun and the strategy involved makes it more exciting to play. It also gives such a rush of adrenaline. But whilst this game is structured beautifully and an incredible game, I do have a few small tips that I think could make this game better than it already is. First of all, an add friend button. Me and my friends love playing servers together and being able to friend other users could make it easier to game together. Also a microphone feature would be great. Chatting with the other users whilst playing out loud could be really great, because you‚Äôd be talking instead of typing through a screen. You‚Äôd be able to pick a game with microphone chatting or without, just whatever you prefer personally. Also being to branch out into private chats with people in the server would be really good. That way you could discuss plans with fellow imposters and win in a better and more strategized way. Also you could chat with friends you‚Äôre playing with separately. It would add a better feature of strategy and even betrayal to the game. You could even use it for persuasion purposes. Those are a few small but very effective features I think us among us users would love and highly appreciate!

This is fun, too, but you have to be prepared for some disappointment. Currently, there are bugs that prevent games from being finished, and these bugs can happen after you‚Äôve played for 30 minutes or more. For example, if somebody owes money, and they try to make another deal to raise more money, this seems to stop the game. It seems to lose track of whose turn it is (and who is still owed money). Sometimes, if someone refuses all your deals for that turn, it ends your turn for some reason, but the End Turn button is still shown. Pressing End Turn at this point stops the game. If you are low on battery life and get a battery warning, it can disconnect you from the game.

And the few moves it gives you to play and the purple blocks that has the bugs in them good luck they get much harder in higher up levels. This level it has the regular white blocks that grow but the purple ones you have to kit them 2 to 3 times and they grow back just one to two moves after you remove another side.

A second thing I would love to see added is a currency like coins or maybe something more creative like aliens. Then, players should receive say, 5 aliens or coins if they win as a crew mate and 10 aliens or coins if they win as imposter. Then, I think players should be able to use these coins/aliens to buy hats or outfits. I also think it would be really cool if we could use this currency to buy higher imposter chances because I would love if I could do that. The third and final thing I would love to see added is a report button. This would be good because I have noticed that some people say weird or disturbing things in my games quite often. I know the creators can‚Äôt control what people say, but it would be nice if they could be reported for it. Overall, I love among us but I would love to see these three things added. P.S.

But ever since Character Creator has been added to the game, my custom skins have been looking off. I use slim-armed skins because I prefer them over classic skins but the glitch only occurs on slim-armed skins. Let‚Äôs say you have a slim-armed skin, and you wanted a unique design on each leg. Like different-lengthened socks, or a flower on one and a star on the other. Then when you upload the skin on the game, whatever way you designed the right leg (it looks like the left leg if you look straight at the skin) gets copy and pasted automatically onto the left leg (right leg if you look at the skin straight at the face). It looks distorted, as I don‚Äôt know if other players can or cannot see the error besides yourself, but it‚Äôs basically both legs are symmetrical while a lot of skin designers like not making symmetrical, and the second layer on the leg that gets changed to looking like the other stays. So basically the glitched leg looks exactly like the other leg that looks perfectly fine, but has second layer on it. Like then both legs would have like a flower on it but the star‚Äôs second layer is stuck on top of the copy and pasted flower. Pretty odd right? For me it makes me feel like I have OCD, I can‚Äôt stand skins that have something off on it, sorry. It doesn‚Äôt do the glitch on classic skins though. So, if you can fix it, please do.","So basically the glitched leg looks exactly like the other leg that looks perfectly fine, but has second layer on it.",5,True,security,negative,9

What I‚Äôm saying is give more chances to get stars. Like as a prize. Instead of just money, give us a little money and a star! Or have different games besides just the one game to match the colors.     Another thing is that it takes so long to complete one floor or one area of the house because of how limited of the stars you have. So I suppose you should just focus on the star problem because it will fix this one of taking so long! üòÜ     Please take this into consideration. The game would be much more entertaining and exciting if I didn‚Äôt give up so much on the game.

When I went to go mine coal it gave me the ore blocks instead of just coal. I didn‚Äôt think much of it until I went to go mine iron and it gave me nothing! This has been happening on every single one of my survival worlds. Maybe because it has Smite 1 on the golden pickaxe but if so why would you give that out to people? I stumbled across a village and went to go see if they had a furnace so I didn‚Äôt have to make one. Halfway through making cooking something in the Blast Furnace it just completely stopped. I tried taking everything out and putting them back in but no. I was really annoyed because I needed to cook food! Since it wasn‚Äôt working I decided to make a regular furnace. Checked the crafting recipe and it wanted a different block than cobble it wanted ‚ÄòBlackstone‚Äô? I didn‚Äôt even know that existed in the game!

A friend of mine can no longer even load the game to play our world together. It's upsetting. It's truly upsetting. The game lags and my world's so corrupted entire chunks glitch out.

It defaults to try to make a trade with the bankrupted player with no option to change it to the other player, so the only way to trade is to wait for the computer to strike a trade with you and then counter the trade. 3 when you get a card that says each player pays $10 for a birthday or whatever, the money never comes out of the players account. Maybe that‚Äôs because of the free parking rule. Not sure. 4 if you use up all of the houses so that there aren‚Äôt any more in reserve, and then sell a hotel, more houses Automatically appear.

However, the game is hard to play on my own time. The game really only works when it wants to. Some are do to bugs, and some are due to just poor design. 1) Game will not load when you go offline still logged into Xbox. It will not let you sign out, and the game crashes repeatedly. I have not found a way to fix this, because even when I try to enable cellular data, it still will not load because no changes in settings are saved before the game crashes. This is extremely inconvenient when I just want to play single player offline. This bug has been going on for months and is consistently overlooked. Please fix this immediately. It discourages players from even attempting to load up their worlds, which ultimately hurts the developers.2) Background music stops when Minecraft is launched. If you are listening to Spotify/Pandora, etc, then the game automatically cuts off your music when you listen to the game. If people didn‚Äôt pause their music before entering the game, then obviously, they want to listen to it while the play! This was definitely programmed in, for reasons I can‚Äôt even begin to comprehend.

Good premise but it holds coins you earn hostage unless you pay to buy it once you accumulate 3000 or 5000 coins. There is no choice either, you watch your coins disappear. The small mini games shown in the ads are the best part but they are way too few and far between. The majority of this game is playing levels over and over trying to get the next star to fix the never ending repairs. I also found having to use stars to open packages annoying. If I‚Äôm getting a gift it should be just. There is some humor and the scenes are colorful which is why i gave it two stars. Had the earning of coins been much higher, the mini games much more prevalent, the bank either free to obtain or at least an option, the limiting of one star per repair and not having to use stars on anything other than repairs I could have seen playing this longer.

So, first off I would like to start this review off with talking about how much I love this game. I downloaded this game years ago and still love it. It‚Äôs ultimately a great game. Here‚Äôs some of my requests you should do. First off, could you guys please make the game where you don‚Äôt need wifi to be able to join people? It always makes road trips boring for me if I want to play minecraft with a friend. Also, if you guys could make it where people can share a wolf. My first wolf from the beginning passed away tonight due to a skeleton attack. Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone‚Äôs been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful. Also if you could make it where villagers, foxes, and mobs can be leashed. That‚Äôs all my requests for now. Thank you!","So, first off I would like to start this review off with talking about how much I love this game.",5,True,general,positive,5

I love how you get to visit new locations (BTW I‚Äôve been to Amsterdam so it was fun to see it in the game.), get cool characters, and enjoy running in the subway.I personally think that the graphics are great. They don‚Äôt have to be perfect, as you can still play the game without problems. I have tried programming before and it IS NOT EASY. I would like to give a shoutout to whoever made this game because it is fabulous, no matter what others say.I do think that the characters are a little over priced, but that is just me. I do like how there are lots of ways to earn the money for them. (Play the game itself, watch adds, get mystery boxes, ETC.)Maybe you could add a feature where you could sign in with another account. I get that you don‚Äôt need an account to play (And that is great!) but my favorite character, Tagbot, is on my other device. I remember him being very expensive and I would love a way to sign into that account on another device so I could get Tagbot back.Thank you for reading this review.

I think you should add this thing before they ban or kick someone,I think it should be said ‚ÄúYou have no reason to ban this person.‚Äù At least,make a server for kids and teens and adults. :( Overall this game is pretty good.

First, maybe when you get the boots that make you jump higher, maybe they can make you jump a little less higher then it does now, sometimes when I jump and I‚Äôm under one of those bridge thing‚Äôs, it kills me. Second, maybe make things a little less expensive (characters, buying coins, buying keys, etc..) because then people would most likely buy your things, like 800 keys is 100 bucks (in real human money), in my opinion that‚Äôs kinda pricey. Also, maybe when your in the air, maybe when you hit the side of the boundary the cop and the dog could come with jet packs, it would make it way more fun if a dog and a cop are flying in the air chasing you! Lastly, maybe in the beginning when you first start you can make the characters go a little faster, when you first start the round/game you go sooo slow, maybe that‚Äôs just me because I am a little impatient, but that‚Äôs just who I am haha. And please don‚Äôt think these suggestions are offending you or your app, I love this game and play it all the time! Just a few suggestions!

It is very entertaining and sometimes I spend hours in a day playing it. The levels seem to get really difficult after you start renovating the third room. I really find it so frustrating that we have to wait 30 minutes for each life to come back. Also, the amount of moves given in each level is ridiculous. Sometimes, you need just 2 more moves to pass the level and you can‚Äôt because you‚Äôre out of moves. Then, if you want more, you have to pay 900 coins for only five more moves. And if you don‚Äôt have the money, you have to forfeit and loose the game. Other times, you can join competitions and get really cool power ups. If I get stuck on one of the levels in the challenges, I loose all my prizes and earned money. The point of the game is to be fun and decorate a house, which honestly is my favorite part of the game. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the matching part of the game is so fun too, I just hate the fact that you have to wait so long to get lives and some of the tasks they ask you to do are just ridiculous. As an example, if I got a cat in the game, it says I need to give a star just to name it. I mean that‚Äôs ridiculous. The game is so fun, and after reading a lot of reviews I do think the game should be updated and should fix these problems.","Also, the amount of moves given in each level is ridiculous.",3,True,general,negative,5

Anyway remember about the imposter imposter chat üí¨ I think it would be helpful Eg: imposter kills crew other crew sees the kill runs to the emergancy meeting button and then the imposter chats to the others imposter that to kill him. And also can there be a feature where we can play on hide and seek mode where imposters have to kill and there vision is low and crewmate vision is high and where there is no reporting bodies and a no emergancy meetings and we know who imposter is and then in 10 seconds imposter gets released I think everyone will love this feature but anyway this is my opinion the game would be very cool with this feature but anyway keep up the good work I also saw a lot of Easter eggs from Henry stink man like the diamond in some tasks and other Easter eggs in polis and a new map would be cool so yeah I love the awesome work keep it up and bye!,I wanted to ask this for a while now can we add friends in among us and we can chat and creat groups?,5,True,general,positive,5

The levels with soap bubbles or oil spreading while you try to keep it at bay while solving the actual puzzle is ridiculous and next to impossible.

Or have different games besides just the one game to match the colors.

The only time something really weird happened was when somebody with a weird name had tried to get us to follow his/her Twitter, but thanks to the new update Among Us blocks your ability to redirect to another website in the chat. Here‚Äôs the thing though. Recently, I ran into another one of the weird-named people, and they said in the chat that the lobby was hacked and he/she had all of the players‚Äô IP addresses. This was an empty threat, as IP addresses are public knowledge (and you can‚Äôt find out where you are based on them)and Apple phones are virtually impossible to hack. However, this really shook me up and I deleted Among Us immediately. I didn‚Äôt want to be hacked. EVER. It was kind of scary even though I knew the extensive anti-hacking measures taken place by InnerSloth (the game‚Äôs creator). While this game is fun, it‚Äôs not worth it being scared every time my friends aren‚Äôt up for a game. If you are getting this for a group of friends/family, then you are fine.

I find them to be fun and even addicting. Although the concept of the game is great, and I‚Äôve only been playing for a short while, something needs to be improved with the coin/lives system. Getting around 50 coins per mini-game, which can take multiple lives to complete, isn‚Äôt sufficient enough. In order to buy a life, 900 coins, you would have to play around 18 rounds just to get enough coins for ONE life. I do not pay money on games, never have never will, but it‚Äôs so frustrating that you may have one move left and instead of paying real cash, not in game coins, you have to wait for a life to replenish just to try and fail at the level again. Each round can take 10+ lives to complete, and it takes quite awhile for the lives to replenish. There should be some kind of reward opportunity other than completing a day, especially because you need to play the mini-games to get stars, in order to complete tasks, to complete the day. That‚Äôs a lot of tasks to do with not a lot of lives/coin rewards!!! If there were events where you can play other mini-games to gain rewards/treasures I think it would be more efficient. I also think 28 minutes is a long time to wait for one single life.

But then the new update with the new chat feature and when I could ONLY use that it became very annoying for me to actually look for what I have to say, and it took too long, then people started thinking that I self report... it‚Äôs better off really that I should just say directly what I saw is my personal preference. So what I did is actually re download my game and lie my age to be older to get past that problem, and it worked from then, now the new update with the new airship which I like the new map, however I am still navigating everything before I play any online games with it. I did the same thingwith the age thing, and it didn‚Äôt give me a choice for the chat. So communication is getting very hard for me, as I heard the same from others before this. So my point is just because of that, makes the game a lot harder and less fun. I sometimes have conversations in the lobby, and it‚Äôs fun, but without that humor expressed or something that sounds like your own words makes the game less fun and sound like a bot.

My first thing and biggest thing is a friends list because sometimes when your playing you meet this awesome person but then one of you have to go and you will never see that person that you bonded with again. Another thing is new colors, hats, and pets. I think there should be a wider variety of colors including gray, dark red, light purple, and a tie color could be awesome! There should be additional hats added as well like a set of head phones, glasses, new wigs, and a set of pretty wings. I also think that there should be more pets and pets that you don‚Äôt have to pay for or like watch a certain amount of adds to unlock this pet or do this to unlock this pet. I think they should add a poddle pet, cat, and a bird would be cool. Something that kinda bothers me is that Mirah HQ (probably spelled wrong) doesn‚Äôt have cameras in it.

These are the two main issues that I have run into that others have as well.  Hopefully this will be resolved soon.",These are the two main issues that I have run into that others have as well.,2,True,general,negative,5

One of my biggest complaints is the fact that you cannot do something as little as pull down your notification screen a smidge without being forced to bear a 20 second+ dimmed out ‚ÄúRejoining game...‚Äù screen. That‚Äôs ridiculous. Why should it take that long to get back in the game when I hardly even left? The connection errors/bugs are ridiculous and make it rare to get a solid game in. That‚Äôs unacceptable, really. What‚Äôs the point in playing a game that‚Äôs likely to crash because of bugs? Also, the lack of any form of communication between players is upsetting. Seriously, no chat box? No ability to use our microphones? You want to charge $4 for a board game and not let us speak to each other? They‚Äôre also charging $30 for a season pass that I believe features strictly cosmetics. üôÑ Marmalade, if you want our money at least give us a solid game. Another complaint I have is the only games rules we have to choose from are: Classic and Quick mode. It would be nice to have the options to change the rules/play custom games and whatnot. To the Monopoly fans, tread carefully because this game was clearly developed as a cash grab and not to give us the mobile Monopoly we would expect in 2020. The base gameplay is acceptable, but the flaws make the game close to unplayable.","üôÑ Marmalade, if you want our money at least give us a solid game.",1,True,efficiency,negative,3

If you want it to be like majority of the other running games going around right now then this game is definitely for you. It is still fun but the ads have turned me away.

This new version is nowhere near as fun to play. Sure, it looks better, and there are more ways for you guys to make more $$ from it, but the new AI algorithm is simply a drag to play. With the old game, if I played 20 games, I could strategize and win about half of them. With this new version, I‚Äôve won only once in 20 games! And that‚Äôs only because I refused to trade. The AI consistently ends up with more funds from giveaways and pays less taxes while the human pays more taxes and gets fewer random giveaways. Please rework the AI algorithm to make it a more enjoyable and better balanced game!!Reply to developer: I never accused the game of being ‚Äúrigged.‚Äù As any programmer knows, there is no such thing as ‚Äúrandom.‚Äù Programming any software takes human choice.

So, first off I would like to start this review off with talking about how much I love this game. I downloaded this game years ago and still love it. It‚Äôs ultimately a great game. Here‚Äôs some of my requests you should do. First off, could you guys please make the game where you don‚Äôt need wifi to be able to join people? It always makes road trips boring for me if I want to play minecraft with a friend. Also, if you guys could make it where people can share a wolf. My first wolf from the beginning passed away tonight due to a skeleton attack. Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone‚Äôs been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful. Also if you could make it where villagers, foxes, and mobs can be leashed. That‚Äôs all my requests for now. Thank you!","First off, could you guys please make the game where you don‚Äôt need wifi to be able to join people?",5,True,effectiveness,negative,2

The characters are nice and honestly kind of funny. üòÑ and I‚Äôm glad you guys even included pets in the game! I like how everything is tried to kept decorated around the house. I like Homescapes much better than gradenscapes just because the colors and the graphics are better int my opinion. At least the game is a little better.     The problem is you have to get stars from playing one game only. And even on a hard level you still get 1 star. It‚Äôs annoying how fast your stars run out. What‚Äôs even more annoying, it‚Äôs that sometimes you have to give one of your stars just to open a box, that you‚Äôve already given a star for box to get to the house! What I‚Äôm saying is give more chances to get stars. Like as a prize. Instead of just money, give us a little money and a star! Or have different games besides just the one game to match the colors.     Another thing is that it takes so long to complete one floor or one area of the house because of how limited of the stars you have. So I suppose you should just focus on the star problem because it will fix this one of taking so long! üòÜ     Please take this into consideration.

The game‚Äôs really fun but there is some stupidity to it like tasks cost so much, but u only get one star for each level, and for every normal level, 50 coins. But if you want more moves after you use them all up, it costs 900 coins. I think that is way too expensive. And I hate how long it takes for lives to refill! Like, 30 minutes to wait for one live! Also, for the harder levels, I think that we should get more stars, not only one!! I think that if they‚Äôre going to go all the way and say that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúsuper hard level‚Äù then they should act like it and give more stars once the level is completed!!

However, the game is hard to play on my own time. The game really only works when it wants to. Some are do to bugs, and some are due to just poor design. 1) Game will not load when you go offline still logged into Xbox. It will not let you sign out, and the game crashes repeatedly. I have not found a way to fix this, because even when I try to enable cellular data, it still will not load because no changes in settings are saved before the game crashes. This is extremely inconvenient when I just want to play single player offline. This bug has been going on for months and is consistently overlooked. Please fix this immediately. It discourages players from even attempting to load up their worlds, which ultimately hurts the developers.2) Background music stops when Minecraft is launched. If you are listening to Spotify/Pandora, etc, then the game automatically cuts off your music when you listen to the game. If people didn‚Äôt pause their music before entering the game, then obviously, they want to listen to it while the play!

Sure, the advertisements can be a bit annoying, but that is really a small hiccup in the game, and besides, a free game has to have some kind of advertisements to keep it alive, so it‚Äôs hardly even a problem. The only real issue I had with this game was connection issues, but again, the game overall kinda shadows out the issues. The tasks/mini games are probably one of the best parts about this game, each one feels fun to do, especially if you can get a rhythm for each task. And the fact that you can have small meetings to decide who they think the murderer/imposter is, is GENIUS.

The ads mostly show the lead character, Austin the Butler, in a sticky situation and the player has to pull levers to get him out of it. The actual game, however, is mostly improving the large house owned by Austin‚Äôs parents.  The sticky situations are called ‚ÄúAustin‚Äôs Bad Dream and in 35 levels, I have only been able to see a few of them.  The game is mostly playing a form of Candy Crush to earn stars in order to improve the home. That part is not so bad. The music is pleasant and the game is a relaxing time waster, at least initially. I don‚Äôt mind using the earned stars to replace furniture or a rug, but as the game goes on, you have to use the stars to do just about anything like answering the door, unpacking a TV, or even starting a new day. And once you‚Äôre out of stars, you can‚Äôt do anything else until you have won more candy crush games and earned more stars. You earn one star from winning each candy crush game no matter how difficult the game is. Win in one round, earn one star. Win after 20 rounds, earn one star. The idea of course is to get the player to purchase items to play longer. I get it.

The other reason I am writing this four stars is because of the AI players sometimes make a terrible trading deal, where one AI ends up with a full street and ready to build houses, where the other is still needing another street, so basically getting the short end of the stick. Dumb moves like that typically put one AI player way ahead of everybody else early in the game, and I would never make a move like that to help one player start building houses before I would be able to do so as well.

It‚Äôs the same game over and over and over again yet you still have people returning to play more which really says something about how great it is. I could play like 20 games in a row and never get bored. A lot of people feel this same way which is probably why the game is so successful and although that‚Äôs good, it comes with a price. That price is more content. People need more and more content and if the demand isn‚Äôt met with even small additions like new tasks or new colors for characters then the game will slowly start to die out. A big thing people want is the ability to have friends. You can play like 40 games with the same person and really bond with them and get to know them, only for both of you to be kicked out of the game for an update or hacking or something and you‚Äôd never be able to see them again.

I thoroughly enjoy the puzzle aspect itself, more so than competing puzzle games. The animations are smoother, the power ups are well thought out and exciting to use, and the puzzles are fun. I'm docking points though, because the storylines are infuriating to deal with. What roped me in to downloading this game was the home decor aspect. As a huge fan of interior design, this seemed like the perfect game for me. I got to play fun levels, but also simultaneously get to decorate a home. However, after spending months on this game, and completing 240 levels, I've only just now unlocked the 3rd room. If you can even call it that. It goes living room, kitchen, and then garden? Why!? There are TONS of rooms in this house, and after TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTY levels, I'm decorating a garden while so much of the house is untouched. Don't even get me started on the baking storyline. 6 stars just to bake the cake base. Another 3 to bake the house cake. Another 3 to frost it. Another 3 to put it together. Then 2 to drive it to the studio. Then 2 to celebrate the win. Then another 2 to open a present for winning... it doesn't stop! I didn't download the game to bake a cake.

I honestly think that it might take a month or almost a year to reach the amount because I‚Äôm not joking, they are really pricey. Unless you playing it nonstop without taking your eyes off the screen then it might take a few weeks. But that‚Äôs still a while. Also the hover boards. They can also get a little pricey.

The character select. Sometimes I get in and it‚Äôs fine. A lot of the time I get in and none of the characters show up only the shadow and the buttons to buy or select the character also don‚Äôt show up. Moving on to the next issue. This may be on purpose and if it is it ain‚Äôt hittin right! There is distortion with the little heavenly voices sound when opening something or getting a prize. It gets extremely deep and stuff and doesn‚Äôt sound right. Moving on the the next and last issue. We can‚Äôt get these cakes in five days especially with all this lag.

I played MCPE one time for a couple minutes on a friends tablet almost 6 years ago and I‚Äôve been hooked ever since. I‚Äôve then watched java and bedrock YT videos up until the point when I downloaded PE this April. One thing I did miss about bedrock though was that the ambience noises were removed. I‚Äôm so happy you re-added them with the nether update. I look forward to more updates like the nether update, although not any that are too massive, because people like me (and there are a lot of us) don‚Äôt want to lose the simplicity of Minecraft we grew up with. We all want improvements (bug fixes and Java parity specifically on this version) but we don‚Äôt massive changes that make Minecraft unrecognizable. For example, the cave update everyone wants, every one expects a massive change but don‚Äôt realize it would completely strip Minecraft if it‚Äôs simple mining aspect. I am probably the only person in the world who doesn‚Äôt want a cave update, but I just don‚Äôt want Minecraft to become something else. I‚Äôm sorry this is so long, and I feel bad if any devs actually read this, but I‚Äôve wanted to get this off my chest for a while. Please don‚Äôt strip Minecraft‚Äôs simplicity from it. This is the game we grew up on, please don‚Äôt make it a different game.

You only have 20 moves to rid the map of enough boxes to get more yellow and blue on the screen and only what‚Äôs left to collect forty of each color! I know these games aren‚Äôt meant to be easy.

Every day of every round I have to keep on pressing a X. Like STOP. Another thing is that the power ups are so short! They only last like five seconds. I think they could fix that in one of there updates. Oh speaking of updates, I love how they change the setting, but why CHANGE your high score. Like seriously! Come on man. My high score was like 80,000. Well HIGHER! They completely reset my high score. At first I was confused because I was proud of my high score, and trying to beat it, but then IT GOT RESET!

Second, maybe make things a little less expensive (characters, buying coins, buying keys, etc..) because then people would most likely buy your things, like 800 keys is 100 bucks (in real human money), in my opinion that‚Äôs kinda pricey. Also, maybe when your in the air, maybe when you hit the side of the boundary the cop and the dog could come with jet packs, it would make it way more fun if a dog and a cop are flying in the air chasing you!

Great, mindless way to decompress after a long day. The update however.... I just downloaded the most recent update to the update and it seems to be a bit better. The controls are still a bit whacked out. It seems to have a hard time figuring out that you are trying to move left when in midair. Always seems to want to roll or jump instead. I do not notice the same when moving right. The pogo sticks need some reworking. I can rarely see which lane the prize is in at the end of the jump. Finally, some of the challenges have not been working. I had one with no rolls or jumps in a certain number of points that would not increment or ever reach success criteria no matter how long I went. Then suddenly would declare success out of the blue.

However, the game is hard to play on my own time. The game really only works when it wants to. Some are do to bugs, and some are due to just poor design. 1) Game will not load when you go offline still logged into Xbox. It will not let you sign out, and the game crashes repeatedly. I have not found a way to fix this, because even when I try to enable cellular data, it still will not load because no changes in settings are saved before the game crashes. This is extremely inconvenient when I just want to play single player offline. This bug has been going on for months and is consistently overlooked. Please fix this immediately. It discourages players from even attempting to load up their worlds, which ultimately hurts the developers.2) Background music stops when Minecraft is launched. If you are listening to Spotify/Pandora, etc, then the game automatically cuts off your music when you listen to the game. If people didn‚Äôt pause their music before entering the game, then obviously, they want to listen to it while the play! This was definitely programmed in, for reasons I can‚Äôt even begin to comprehend.

Since the last update, I have had several games that just freeze and you are out of luck.  What a waste of one, two hours plus, very frustrating.  The other really big issue is if you purchase the color block of Virginia, St Charles and States,  the Houses and Hotels tab covers Virginia and States and there is no way to add Houses and Hotels.

I've had three explosives lined together but I can't mix all three together. I haven't had 4 or more alined but that would be more awesome.

When you join ‚ÄúOnline Multiplayer‚Äù, and you‚Äôre playing, you can leave the app and come back however long later, and the game would continue from where you left off. This is the first evidence of AI in an online supposed real person mode. The second bit of evidence is that the AI trades at very specific rates: when you‚Äôre paying cash for a property, they want double the property price. If you offer too much lower than double, they‚Äôll permanently reject the offer. Closer to double, and they‚Äôll counter for double. Third bit of evidence is when they offer you a trade, and you decline. If they offered money, they‚Äôll make another offer increasing their offer by 10$. Decline again, they‚Äôll increase by 10$ again. And so on. Another issue is that on Multiplayer with friends, if you accidentally leave the app, you‚Äôre instantly replaced with an AI and there‚Äôs no way for you to rejoin.

Me in contrary, is landing on every single one of their and gets all the chance cards which make me pay more. The chance cards they land on gives them money no matter what in the endgame.

So, first off I would like to start this review off with talking about how much I love this game. I downloaded this game years ago and still love it. It‚Äôs ultimately a great game. Here‚Äôs some of my requests you should do. First off, could you guys please make the game where you don‚Äôt need wifi to be able to join people? It always makes road trips boring for me if I want to play minecraft with a friend. Also, if you guys could make it where people can share a wolf. My first wolf from the beginning passed away tonight due to a skeleton attack. Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone‚Äôs been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful. Also if you could make it where villagers, foxes, and mobs can be leashed. That‚Äôs all my requests for now. Thank you!",Here‚Äôs some of my requests you should do.,5,True,general,positive,5

Second, the animations are so annoying!  (Frankly, they were annoying in the old version, too) They are in the way so I can‚Äôt see the right side of the board. They are too long and they don‚Äôt get shorter when you play a quick game. Third, some of the options in the older version aren‚Äôt in the newer one like removing those animations, slight of hand, starting allowance, starting properties, etc.  Fourth, it‚Äôs pretty obvious whose turn it is, so I don‚Äôt need an obnoxious banner across the screen before every freaking turn!  Finally, the main reason I got this version was because I was hoping the trade AI would get better, but not really. It got slightly better when doing a human to computer trade, but the computer to computer trades are pathetic. It‚Äôs like they all gang up to get monopolies so the human can‚Äôt get one. I haven‚Äôt tried online, and I won‚Äôt because I can‚Äôt in good conscience ask someone to buy this garbage. If I could get a refund, I absolutely would.

But when you have 10 more moves left and you win the level you are lucky to win 58 coins?!?!  And you just better break out your dollars because some levels you will be killing yourselves to win. Like 498 level I am not going to spend anymore money on this game. And the few moves it gives you to play and the purple blocks that has the bugs in them good luck they get much harder in higher up levels. This level it has the regular white blocks that grow but the purple ones you have to kit them 2 to 3 times and they grow back just one to two moves after you remove another side. To get extra coins for more lives or boosters it is a lot of money for what little you get. 900 coins you get 3 this. And 1900 coins you get 3 globes. The lives run out so fast and sometimes my friends send me lives I see them and play one game go back to collect the life because it won‚Äôt allow you to have 6 life‚Äôs and it is missing. I am in the room right at the stairs I forget what it is called. Looks like another living room to me. The outside green house it felt like it took years to finish the plot line. I wish you could request the boosters but place them where you want them if you want them in the game.

Or when the impostor impales you with their tongue, it could be a body with a hole in its head. Thanks for reading!

I offered everything I had plus ONE THOUSAND dollars and the AI refused my trade. The next turn he rolled, landed on Boardwalk, completed the set, and put several houses on each. I‚Äôm pretty intelligent and am very good at recognizing patterns. Not saying it‚Äôs rigged, but adding this to the difficulty level makes the game incredibly frustrating and not fun to play.","Not saying it‚Äôs rigged, but adding this to the difficulty level makes the game incredibly frustrating and not fun to play.",3,True,enjoyability,negative,4

I mean I‚Äôm trying to make faces with text and it doesn‚Äôt let me. Mostly it would just make talking with others more fun. Number two is microphone. We should be able to make the settings of a game to be microphone only because honestly it‚Äôs easier and takes less time to talk. Number three hide and seek game mode. I know you guys mentioned this when you announced Among Us 2 but you have cancelled it so I hope you add it to Among Us 1. Number four updates. Now I‚Äôm not complaining that mobile players get updates later I‚Äôm just saying that at the time I‚Äôm typing this everyday I get into an among us lobby at least once it says I need to update and then I go to the App Store and I can‚Äôt update. Now I don‚Äôt know how updates for this game work since I‚Äôve never experienced an actual update for it before.

This is obviously built on that annoying subscription model for premium services. And it‚Äôs not free in the first place. No, I don‚Äôt want to pay extra for a new board or player piece...it‚Äôs just software. Give me a break.Second, there are some pretty bad playability issues. One is initiating trades; the user interface makes it impossible to pick multiple things on the left half of the screen because the player boxes cover the properties. Another is that tapping anywhere near the bottom right when trying to select one of your own properties causes the game to think you tapped the ‚Äúend turn‚Äù button, screwing up your turn. Another horrible gameplay thing is the fact that AI players constantly choose ‚Äúauction‚Äù instead of buying properties outright, which is not at all like how people in real life play the game. Not only that, but the AI player that initiated the auction will bid all the way up to the original cost of the property...why on earth would anyone ever do that? Sloppy gameplay for sure.The older Monopoly game on the App Store, which I purchased long ago, was quite a bit better.

There are 2 that really stick out. The first one starts once you get to about 100k score, but gets more prevalent once you get to about 250k. What it happens is, when you jump from the ramp up onto the train, and land on the train, you stay floating, and it won‚Äôt let you jump or roll, once you go to the left or right, it‚Äôs fixed though. That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs fine though, because if you don‚Äôt notice it, it might kill you. The second, and worse of the two comes down to the hit-boxes. This just happened to me right before writing this review. On top of the trains, sometimes you just want to go left or right, but when you try, you stumble into nothing. That just happened to me... two trains in a row and it got me killed. Luckily I had just started the round and it seems to happen in the early stages most often so at least it‚Äôs hard to ruin your high score with that glitch, but that one is much more annoying because you can‚Äôt avoid it.

They are annoying at worst and a wonderful addition for shrewd dealing humans, at best. The klunky repetitious and nonsensical ‚Äúoffers‚Äù they make are pretty bad. And the fact that they only assess deals based on value of the deeds and classifying them as ‚Äúeasy, medium, or hard‚Äù just improves their luck and reduces yours makes them pretty frustrating at times.

I use slim-armed skins because I prefer them over classic skins but the glitch only occurs on slim-armed skins. Let‚Äôs say you have a slim-armed skin, and you wanted a unique design on each leg. Like different-lengthened socks, or a flower on one and a star on the other. Then when you upload the skin on the game, whatever way you designed the right leg (it looks like the left leg if you look straight at the skin) gets copy and pasted automatically onto the left leg (right leg if you look at the skin straight at the face). It looks distorted, as I don‚Äôt know if other players can or cannot see the error besides yourself, but it‚Äôs basically both legs are symmetrical while a lot of skin designers like not making symmetrical, and the second layer on the leg that gets changed to looking like the other stays. So basically the glitched leg looks exactly like the other leg that looks perfectly fine, but has second layer on it. Like then both legs would have like a flower on it but the star‚Äôs second layer is stuck on top of the copy and pasted flower. Pretty odd right? For me it makes me feel like I have OCD, I can‚Äôt stand skins that have something off on it, sorry. It doesn‚Äôt do the glitch on classic skins though.

When you join ‚ÄúOnline Multiplayer‚Äù, and you‚Äôre playing, you can leave the app and come back however long later, and the game would continue from where you left off. This is the first evidence of AI in an online supposed real person mode. The second bit of evidence is that the AI trades at very specific rates: when you‚Äôre paying cash for a property, they want double the property price. If you offer too much lower than double, they‚Äôll permanently reject the offer. Closer to double, and they‚Äôll counter for double. Third bit of evidence is when they offer you a trade, and you decline. If they offered money, they‚Äôll make another offer increasing their offer by 10$. Decline again, they‚Äôll increase by 10$ again. And so on. Another issue is that on Multiplayer with friends, if you accidentally leave the app, you‚Äôre instantly replaced with an AI and there‚Äôs no way for you to rejoin. This makes your phone unusable other than to play the game if you don‚Äôt want to erase all the progress you‚Äôve just made on a match with a friend. Please look into this. TLDR: ‚ÄúOnline Multiplayer‚Äù isn‚Äôt online multiplayer. There may be one or two ‚Äúreal‚Äù people in every game of 4, but never a full game of 4 real people.

Subway Surfers by Killow is just the app to get.  To start with I like all the powerups.  A powerup is a thing that you can get that can help you get more coins.  I like the jetpack powerup because it gives you lots of coins without the police officer chasing you.  I also like the magnet power up because you can get all the coins for a couple seconds without crashing. I also like how you can get keys.  Keys are things that are hard to get but you can get a lot of stuff with them like outfits and hoverboards.  For example, you can get characters with them.  I also like how you can get keys by doing stuff like getting 810 coins in one run you can get 8 keys.  Last of all, I like how you can watch videos to get things.  For example, you can watch a video every day to get two keys and you can also get super mystery boxes by watching videos too.  Last, I like  if you are at 0 coins or 0 keys, you can watch videos nonstop and get 10 keys in 15 minutes or get 10,000 coins in 20 minutes.  As you can see this is a very good game.

I have a few suggestions for things you could add or fix. My first thing and biggest thing is a friends list because sometimes when your playing you meet this awesome person but then one of you have to go and you will never see that person that you bonded with again. Another thing is new colors, hats, and pets. I think there should be a wider variety of colors including gray, dark red, light purple, and a tie color could be awesome! There should be additional hats added as well like a set of head phones, glasses, new wigs, and a set of pretty wings. I also think that there should be more pets and pets that you don‚Äôt have to pay for or like watch a certain amount of adds to unlock this pet or do this to unlock this pet. I think they should add a poddle pet, cat, and a bird would be cool. Something that kinda bothers me is that Mirah HQ (probably spelled wrong) doesn‚Äôt have cameras in it.

Speaking of Mimi, if I‚Äôm correct she does have a pet otter which is super cute. I don‚Äôt know if the otter runs with her when she is trying to evade the inspector, but if it does I think that the Subway Surfers team should have a pet isle where players can choose an animal to run with them like the inspector has a dog. I would absolutely DIE if that could happen. I also definitely think that younger players would enjoy this. Please consider because I think it will definitely draw more attention to this amazing game. Besides that I think this game has amazing graphics and deserves to have ‚Äúhype‚Äù I also like how you guys make different maps that represent different parts of the world.

It is a great game to play with friends and just play in your free time. I love being the imposter and being a crewmate is just as fun.

It makes the game a little less fun, but it is still great. Though, recently, they updated it so that in the chat, you cannot say things that you want to say and instead you can only say stuff like ‚ÄúBlah is the imposter!‚Äù or ‚ÄúBlah vented!‚Äù (The imposter can go though vents to travel faster.) It is WAY more confusing than the older version and it makes it a little less enjoyable. When I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to operate the chat to say something, people assumed I was the imposter and voted me out. (You can vote people out if people vote them out.) I know that they did this so that it can be safer so that people don‚Äôt say bad words, but it is difficult. Also, I know that the people who made among us cannot change this, but could you at least put ‚ÄúI am having trouble using the chat,‚Äù or something like that?

Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone‚Äôs been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful.

Also, can you add a new character: Toon Bot?Toon Bot would be the normal robot body, like tagbot and tankbot,Just a few design changes. For the head, it would be a screen like a TV, changing facial expressions. The TV head would glitch, or bug out whenever the player is caught or damaged. The second costume for Toonbot would be a retro, video game style with a more modern, clean tv instead of an old, 1990 style tv. It would come with a new board witch would simply be a TV remote, special purchasable powers for the board would be zap sideways and super speed. This might add a but of modern-day style to the game.

But ever since Character Creator has been added to the game, my custom skins have been looking off. I use slim-armed skins because I prefer them over classic skins but the glitch only occurs on slim-armed skins. Let‚Äôs say you have a slim-armed skin, and you wanted a unique design on each leg. Like different-lengthened socks, or a flower on one and a star on the other. Then when you upload the skin on the game, whatever way you designed the right leg (it looks like the left leg if you look straight at the skin) gets copy and pasted automatically onto the left leg (right leg if you look at the skin straight at the face). It looks distorted, as I don‚Äôt know if other players can or cannot see the error besides yourself, but it‚Äôs basically both legs are symmetrical while a lot of skin designers like not making symmetrical, and the second layer on the leg that gets changed to looking like the other stays. So basically the glitched leg looks exactly like the other leg that looks perfectly fine, but has second layer on it. Like then both legs would have like a flower on it but the star‚Äôs second layer is stuck on top of the copy and pasted flower. Pretty odd right? For me it makes me feel like I have OCD, I can‚Äôt stand skins that have something off on it, sorry. It doesn‚Äôt do the glitch on classic skins though.

Here‚Äôs the thing though. Recently, I ran into another one of the weird-named people, and they said in the chat that the lobby was hacked and he/she had all of the players‚Äô IP addresses. This was an empty threat, as IP addresses are public knowledge (and you can‚Äôt find out where you are based on them)and Apple phones are virtually impossible to hack.

I noticed the changes made to the game. And then when sunset arrived, memories came flooding back. The memories of summer nights spent with friends in this little world that taught us so much.

I‚Äôve been playing it since I was 8 years old, and it‚Äôs come a long way since then. Most games I play I usually play them for about a month or two, three at the most, and then forget about it. But Minecraft is different. It‚Äôs stuck with me for a long time now (almost 6 years). It‚Äôs a great game to play with friends and family, whether you want to create a massive structure or survive in the wilderness while fighting monsters, or do a bit of both. However, like every game, it does need some improvements. First of all, I suggest that it have a wider variety of animals in the game, (elephants, lions, tigers, sharks, etc). Also, I think their should be more options of furniture, especially in creative mode, rather than having to use steps as chairs. There are also a few glitches that can be annoying. For example, if you add to many mobs in creative, it will lag out your game. Also, there was this one time that I had to delete and reinstall the game because it wouldn‚Äôt let me open up the game.

And when i go into one the minigames, that minigame being High-School Roleplay there are problems with my custom skin. So idk if this has to do with the server but this has happened most of the time. I walk around and when i pull up the pause menu my custom skin is replaced with a random skin. And I sometimes see other players with my skin equipped. And idk if my skin is working or not. Even when i do the inventory menu my custom skin is still there. So Mojang, if you see this then please reach out to me. My Minecraft account is a Xbox live account named Endermen21YT. So please if you can, look into this. Now this could totally just be the server or something else so this might not even be happening. I‚Äôve even noticed that this has happened to other ppl before on those servers. And it only happens when I enter the minigame. In the main server my skin‚Äôs fine. So anyway yeah that‚Äôs all.

What it happens is, when you jump from the ramp up onto the train, and land on the train, you stay floating, and it won‚Äôt let you jump or roll, once you go to the left or right, it‚Äôs fixed though. That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs fine though, because if you don‚Äôt notice it, it might kill you. The second, and worse of the two comes down to the hit-boxes. This just happened to me right before writing this review. On top of the trains, sometimes you just want to go left or right, but when you try, you stumble into nothing. That just happened to me... two trains in a row and it got me killed.

I have come across some really disgusting conversations within the game between people. If kids starting from the age of 9+ can play this game there should be a way to report people saying explicit inappropriate things. Each person should get a profile and there should be a system of reporting people. Yes you can kick people out of a server but you have to also get three other people to do too or be the one who made the server. There needs to be a better system in place. There has been a time where I entered a server and someone was trying to get personal information out of a 12 year old (at least that is how old the person said they were). That is NOT okay. Luckily other people within the server stepped in and we told the kid not to share that information but there really needs to be a system in place. There have also been times of people bullying other people. This is also not okay and just another reason there needs to be a way to report people for misconduct. I did not find this game to have a safe environment for me or for children. It is a great concept but not at all what I would consider safe for children at the age of 9.

The ads mostly show the lead character, Austin the Butler, in a sticky situation and the player has to pull levers to get him out of it. The actual game, however, is mostly improving the large house owned by Austin‚Äôs parents.  The sticky situations are called ‚ÄúAustin‚Äôs Bad Dream and in 35 levels, I have only been able to see a few of them.  The game is mostly playing a form of Candy Crush to earn stars in order to improve the home. That part is not so bad. The music is pleasant and the game is a relaxing time waster, at least initially. I don‚Äôt mind using the earned stars to replace furniture or a rug, but as the game goes on, you have to use the stars to do just about anything like answering the door, unpacking a TV, or even starting a new day. And once you‚Äôre out of stars, you can‚Äôt do anything else until you have won more candy crush games and earned more stars. You earn one star from winning each candy crush game no matter how difficult the game is. Win in one round, earn one star. Win after 20 rounds, earn one star. The idea of course is to get the player to purchase items to play longer. I get it. Most games I have seen do the same thing, but they don‚Äôt ramp up the difficulty so quickly.","The sticky situations are called ‚ÄúAustin‚Äôs Bad Dream and in 35 levels, I have only been able to see a few of them.",3,True,enjoyability,negative,4

The amount of coins that are needed to buy things like boosters and lives are crazy high. 900 coins for 5more moves on a level is crazy and then if you want to do it again, it‚Äôs 1200! When you only win between 50 and 100 coins ( on a really good round) it takes a really long time to recoup. They are very stingy with giving you boosters and chances to get more coins. I play other games that are very generous with coins and boosters which allows me to play and enjoy the game. Isn‚Äôt that what the game should be all about? Challenging levels are one thing, but when it takes so many lives to win a level it‚Äôs not fun anymore. I won 2 hours, played constantly for that time and only made it through 2 levels.

I had a property of every color in my last game to ensure no one can build, so what happens? Yup, I land on their railroads only. So what do I do? I buy one of their railroads for a ridiculous price.

It‚Äôs so fun and the strategy involved makes it more exciting to play. It also gives such a rush of adrenaline. But whilst this game is structured beautifully and an incredible game, I do have a few small tips that I think could make this game better than it already is. First of all, an add friend button. Me and my friends love playing servers together and being able to friend other users could make it easier to game together. Also a microphone feature would be great. Chatting with the other users whilst playing out loud could be really great, because you‚Äôd be talking instead of typing through a screen. You‚Äôd be able to pick a game with microphone chatting or without, just whatever you prefer personally. Also being to branch out into private chats with people in the server would be really good. That way you could discuss plans with fellow imposters and win in a better and more strategized way. Also you could chat with friends you‚Äôre playing with separately. It would add a better feature of strategy and even betrayal to the game. You could even use it for persuasion purposes.

Now, after updating the game from not playing it for over a year, the game lags for seemingly no reason (it runs smoother with the internet turned off and turning off multiplayer seems to make little difference). Some sounds are still present in the game but some sounds don't play at all such as picking up blocks or when you get hurt or die. Enemies do not make unique sounds when hit and has a seemingly stock sound effect playing. I have not had problem with infinite maps before; however, I now have problems with all maps. The game only feels playable when all high end settings are disabled, mob spawning is disabled, and setting gameplay to peaceful. In addition, the UI is not touch screen friendly like it was in the alpha and beta. I know that I am using old hardware but this many problems for a game that ran otherwise smoothly in the past is ridiculous. One final criticism is that unlike the alpha and beta there are only two rendering options that make the hot bar look pointless: 5 and 6. Make it 1 to 6 so that old players such as myself can play the game optimally. I think the last one is the main reason for a lot of issues aside from sound effects.",Some sounds are still present in the game but some sounds don't play at all such as picking up blocks or when you get hurt or die.,3,True,enjoyability,negative,4

It‚Äôs a really fun game that you should share with your friends and challenge each other. Sometimes you can even get a new high score.

Second of all, there has been numerous amount of glitches in the past few days. To start off, it will randomly kick you out of a game while you‚Äôre  in the middle of one. This really makes me mad and frustrated because of how many times it‚Äôs happened. Next, there is a hacker. You will join a game and the screen will be all black and you can free run wherever. Then when you check the chat it has a link telling you random stuff and to vote for trump. This can be really scary for young ones and we should also not bring any thing political into a game that kids are playing for fun. Also, in the text it says it will hack with your WiFi. Which is true, not for me, but people I know. It logs them out of their WiFi and disconnects them where they can or rejoin. I would really recommend to wait to download the app until these bugs have been fixed. Thankfully, they have said that instead of making an ‚ÄúAmomg us #2‚Äù they will wait of and be trying to fix these bugs instead. I would wait until around November, as they said that‚Äôs when it should be fixed. I also say you should be 12+ to have this game.

What if there was a role called ‚ÄúJester‚Äù where their goal is to get ejected, making them win? Sounds like it could be a hit or miss, but I think that‚Äôd be cool. Also a role of ‚ÄúDetective‚Äù sounds interesting. Like, you can give that person the option to take screenshots, so they can have solid alibis/evidence of the imposter, but only they have it, so that the crew mates don‚Äôt have too much of an advantage. They can send the screenshots to the chat, helping out their case (maybe also a limited amount of screenshots so their not overpowered?). Also the idea of adding friends would be cool! It‚Äôs sad you can‚Äôt add anyone, and the strangers you could enjoy playing with you‚Äôll only play with once. It would also be nice to adopt mini crew mates whenever their parent dies, I just think that would be very wholesome.

However, the game is hard to play on my own time. The game really only works when it wants to. Some are do to bugs, and some are due to just poor design. 1) Game will not load when you go offline still logged into Xbox. It will not let you sign out, and the game crashes repeatedly. I have not found a way to fix this, because even when I try to enable cellular data, it still will not load because no changes in settings are saved before the game crashes. This is extremely inconvenient when I just want to play single player offline. This bug has been going on for months and is consistently overlooked. Please fix this immediately. It discourages players from even attempting to load up their worlds, which ultimately hurts the developers.2) Background music stops when Minecraft is launched. If you are listening to Spotify/Pandora, etc, then the game automatically cuts off your music when you listen to the game. If people didn‚Äôt pause their music before entering the game, then obviously, they want to listen to it while the play!

I don't want to stop playing but I run out of lives so I have no choice. Lol. I think I like it better than Gardenscapes and I love Gardenscapes too.  I like how you can put different types of explosives together or two of the same to make a bigger explosive. It would be even greater if you could put more than two together. I've had three explosives lined together but I can't mix all three together. I haven't had 4 or more alined but that would be more awesome. With Gardenscapes it seems like I'm not able to complete and able to upgrade or rebuild anything as quickly as I seem to be able to with Homescapes. So if you wanted to change something with Gardenscapes that would be one thing.  I guess it's a little harder to complete a level. You can't mix two explosives like you can with Homescapes. It's just totally different with the match game with Homescapes it seems to me. I love it and I can't get enough of it. I'm always wondering what the next level is going to be like.

They are annoying at worst and a wonderful addition for shrewd dealing humans, at best. The klunky repetitious and nonsensical ‚Äúoffers‚Äù they make are pretty bad. And the fact that they only assess deals based on value of the deeds and classifying them as ‚Äúeasy, medium, or hard‚Äù just improves their luck and reduces yours makes them pretty frustrating at times.

They're pop-up, not videos, so they don't disrupt your game. However, like all games, this one has some problems. My biggest issue is the top run. Every week, the contestants get harder to beat, and eventually you can't get past the last person in the silver because they have over a million. Also, if you get a really good medal, like the diamond, you don't get to keep it for the next week because it changes depending on where you are that week. Another problem is the keys. To revive yourself, you have to pay more and more each time, until it gets so expensive that you can't even afford it. The only way to get keys is in the run, in mystery boxes, or in awards, which is a huge problem because: you only find a key in a run about every eighteen games or so, and if you miss it, then you don't have a chance to get another one. It is extremely rare to get a key in a mystery box, and when you do, it's only one, which can't even begin to pay for the expenses of reviving yourself. It takes a long time to earn a reward, which only gives you three keys, five if you're lucky. So overall, this game is pretty good, but it could use some improvements.","To revive yourself, you have to pay more and more each time, until it gets so expensive that you can't even afford it.",4,True,cost,negative,1

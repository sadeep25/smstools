That said. First time we tried to play I went around the board 3 x (2nd player) before landing on a property. Meanwhile player one landing on great stuff. Player three some properties but lots of cards taking money. The chance or community chest before park place, number 3 landed on it 3x in 4 turns and was sent to st Charles. Second game number 3 landed on Baltic pl , which got hoteled early because number 1 got sets and $ every turn. Not kidding and then 2 & 3 landed on his properties most turns. Number 1 would skate past anything coating. Landed in Go to collect $400 almost ever time while number 3 landed on Baltic or the next square for income tax. I’m all for fun, but it’s not balanced. It takes the fun out of it because it’s not fair. And before you say it can happen. I’m 53 and not a poor sport, it doesn’t happen that ‘luckily’.

However, I am confident that the game will continue to be hashed out in the coming months and eventually will fix the bugs and add more features.The amount of games that are completed before some kind of bug freezes up the game is very slim. This is unfortunate for a game that requires a decent time investment to complete. I also find myself wondering what happens when a player decides to quit. Is that why the game freezes? Are they replaced with an AI? If so, why doesn’t it tell me that I’m playing AI? Is the game freezing from and idle player? If so, can there be a boot timer? Are people rewarded for finishing games? Are people penalized for not finishing games? It would be great to have some kind of stat collection that keeps track of your wins and matches you up with similarly skilled players.There are a lot of features such as described above that can be found in the Settlers of Catan app that I think would be very beneficial to Monopoly.",The game has great potential but there are too many issues to warrant paying $4 to play at the moment.,4,True,cost,negative,1

I love this game! The idea is classic, like mafia but in space. It can be technically called a brain game because the idea of lying and deceiving your “team” is very cool way to stretch your detective skills. Personally, this game is really fun! I wouldn’t give this game anything below 5 stars! But, there are a lot of things that concern me a little to. First, the over usage of bad words and #. It’s pretty hard to find a game where no one is constantly cussing inappropriate things in the chat, which ruins the game for everyone! On the other hand, there are some ridiculous hashtags marked on a word that isn’t even bad! Some people also put very disgusting things as their names. Another thing I would like to suggest is adding friends! Me and my friend just started playing together yesterday but it was very hard to get her into the same game as I am. Sometimes it’s very boring if we start a new game as host and no one’s joining! I think it would be nice to friend request and then we can request our friends to be able to join the public server we are in! It would save a ton of time.

After playing very frequently, I’ve been noticing some issues. 1. Dice rolls do not seem random. Quite frequently the computer rolls the perfect number to squeak by your hotels. It happens way too often. 2 when playing multiple computer opponents, if the first computer player on the list of players on the right side of the screen goes bankrupt, you can no longer purpose a deal with the other remaining opponent. It defaults to try to make a trade with the bankrupted player with no option to change it to the other player, so the only way to trade is to wait for the computer to strike a trade with you and then counter the trade. 3 when you get a card that says each player pays $10 for a birthday or whatever, the money never comes out of the players account. Maybe that’s because of the free parking rule. Not sure. 4 if you use up all of the houses so that there aren’t any more in reserve, and then sell a hotel, more houses Automatically appear. Seems odd.

I think we should have an improvement or 2 (I’m not sure if it is 2, but it’s still worth the game) for this. It has an excellent interference facing the game but there can be simply a better idea for the game. Also, it has a awesome story. It tells about a person about a house that has to be renovated. This takes talent. The only way is that we did our skills. And the puzzles facing our ways. That’s the concert. To be honest, it also has days. This never happened in most games in my life. The only reason why because we have to fix the house. I don’t know why else. But it can also be dived into sections of the game. This is what a like so much. This app appears to be too similar to Candy Crush. But it has different things to do. And this is also having similar power ups. One more thing before closing the review. 900 coins is a lot for 5 moves. I think you need 1/3 of the amount (300 coins) and save 900 coins for 5 more moves and another thing. Overall it is a good game. I hope you have a wonderful update very soon. Great game 5/5 stars.",This game has been great for a total amount of time.,5,True,enjoyability,positive,4

But then the new update with the new chat feature and when I could ONLY use that it became very annoying for me to actually look for what I have to say, and it took too long, then people started thinking that I self report... it’s better off really that I should just say directly what I saw is my personal preference. So what I did is actually re download my game and lie my age to be older to get past that problem, and it worked from then, now the new update with the new airship which I like the new map, however I am still navigating everything before I play any online games with it. I did the same thingwith the age thing, and it didn’t give me a choice for the chat. So communication is getting very hard for me, as I heard the same from others before this. So my point is just because of that, makes the game a lot harder and less fun. I sometimes have conversations in the lobby, and it’s fun, but without that humor expressed or something that sounds like your own words makes the game less fun and sound like a bot. And then some of us would rather play Roblox, Minecraft, GTA, that sort of stuff instead. Thanks for reading my opinion on how I think of this game currently! - Dylan (Otherwise known as “Dylan Cat” on the game)","I remember the day I first played this game, and it very quickly got addicting.",3,True,enjoyability,positive,4

I thoroughly enjoy the puzzle aspect itself, more so than competing puzzle games. The animations are smoother, the power ups are well thought out and exciting to use, and the puzzles are fun. I'm docking points though, because the storylines are infuriating to deal with. What roped me in to downloading this game was the home decor aspect. As a huge fan of interior design, this seemed like the perfect game for me. I got to play fun levels, but also simultaneously get to decorate a home. However, after spending months on this game, and completing 240 levels, I've only just now unlocked the 3rd room. If you can even call it that. It goes living room, kitchen, and then garden? Why!? There are TONS of rooms in this house, and after TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTY levels, I'm decorating a garden while so much of the house is untouched. Don't even get me started on the baking storyline. 6 stars just to bake the cake base. Another 3 to bake the house cake. Another 3 to frost it. Another 3 to put it together. Then 2 to drive it to the studio. Then 2 to celebrate the win. Then another 2 to open a present for winning... it doesn't stop! I didn't download the game to bake a cake. I downloaded it to furnish a house! Stop with that nonsense. It took WEEKS to get through that ridiculous storyline. I hope the developers listen to this criticism, because it's really really turning me off to an otherwise fantastic game.",Then 2 to celebrate the win.,3,True,general,positive,5

And getting a feel for the game, but recently I’ve been playing multiplayer. Now multiplayer is fun and all especially when I’m winning cuz I’ll have a few thousand and a row of hotels that bankrupt two other players. But then it’s always fun to just flash my wealth around and buy properties from the last player just so that it’s harder for them, but every time I do this (or just if I trade properties for money in general when someone’s bankrupt) it gets me stuck on the keep property mortgaged page. So I click unmorggage. Then I click it again. Then five minutes later I’m still spam clicking the button and I have to leave to solve the problem. I’ve tried everything I could but it always does this. Monopoly’s a great game and all but honestly I’ll probably just delete the game because it’s just annoying and frustrating when I have a hotel on boardwalk, all the railroads, and like 10 other hotels, while the other player has two properties left unmortgaged, then they win because the lousy game crashes on me. So just make sure you can actually handle monopoly on your device because I’m assuming it has something to do with that.

All was going well at first. A little lag but I could blame that on my internet. Then, about an hour in our play my game disconnected me. No big deal, it’s something that can happen sometimes and I can just join right back in. But after 5 minutes it did it again. Then again. And again. Keep in mind I was sitting right next to my router and had all my bars and yet the game kept booting me from the server. I bounced the internet twice and still came out with the same results. Sometimes I would close the entire game and reopen it only to find that the world wouldn’t even pop up. We were stuck in this complicated dance for over an hour before we decided to call it quits out of utter frustration. There is no way this could just be my internet. Not only was I mere inches away from the router but I was the only one in my house. Nobody else was connected to the internet but me so why did I keep getting booted out of the server?

For example, every task around the house goes from costing one star to two. The rewards aren’t sufficient to the amount of boosts being spent on harder levels. Some levels are so hard and waste so many lives that you have to use boosts just to get through it. There should be more levels that don’t take multiple tries to get through. Some of the tasks that the game makes you do are stupid. The game is trying to get you to use all your stars so you have to play more, which is typical, but with the levels so hard, it’s really just a tactic to get people to spend more money. It’s also takes way too long for the lives to reload. It’s like 25mins per life. I really liked this game at the start but the further I’ve gotten, the less I want to continue playing. Instead of throwing in so many different aspects into the puzzle games so soon, they should have waited and made it harder much later. I’m only in the kitchen and I spend on average 3-5 lives on each level. I try not to use boosters because they are so hard to earn. Paying 900coins to get 5 more moves on one level, when each level earns you roughly 50-70 coins (hard levels earn you 100+) is just sad. In conclusion, this game only remains fun for the first 60 levels then gets frustrating.

Would be nice to see the city in 3D more often during gameplay. The “your turn” banner obstructs the dice momentarily. The dice should never be obstructed. When adding houses to the purple properties, the add houses button extends over the purple properties making it difficult to add properties there. I find myself accidentally not buying a property because the buy or not buy buttons are too close together. Maybe a different layout for buying properties. For games against the computer it would be nice to limit the number of times the computer offers a trade. It gets to the point where it is offering trades on every dice roll which slows the game down. For the custom rule set, having an option to start the game with more money would be nice.

Minecraft is one of the best games out there at least for me it is. I basically grew up playing it on my xbox 360. Nothing wrong with the gameplay or anything. But I do have one complaint.

And when i go into one the minigames, that minigame being High-School Roleplay there are problems with my custom skin. So idk if this has to do with the server but this has happened most of the time. I walk around and when i pull up the pause menu my custom skin is replaced with a random skin. And I sometimes see other players with my skin equipped. And idk if my skin is working or not. Even when i do the inventory menu my custom skin is still there. So Mojang, if you see this then please reach out to me. My Minecraft account is a Xbox live account named Endermen21YT. So please if you can, look into this. Now this could totally just be the server or something else so this might not even be happening. I’ve even noticed that this has happened to other ppl before on those servers. And it only happens when I enter the minigame. In the main server my skin’s fine. So anyway yeah that’s all.

I remember when there was a girl in Minecraft, and the old avatars.. (Notch messed up a bit..) it’s a fun and awesome game. The days of beta were the best. I remember surprise Friday or Friday surprise, but then it stopped. Until an exception- Surprise Saturday. Ah yes. I remember why polar bears were added in the game, and the reason. Jeb’s wife (I think it’s Jeb’s..) liked polar bears, so that’s why they were added. The original Mobil lite version, and I remember when Minecraft PE was free. All this time it’s been downloaded in my cloud storage, so I never had to buy it. (Heh) This game never stops improving. But of course, I’m more of a Java version myself, of course. The days of me and the boys, staying up all night, gaming, building whatever we could. I also remember the day when Microsoft bought Mojang, or did they buy Minecraft? Anyways. The first minecon was about 30 people, mostly Notches’ family. The good ol days of Minecraft. A few things could be changed though. The shooting speed of skeletons is very high, I dislike that, I have some other things, but I don’t want to keep you from doing your jobs. Thanks so much for these amazing 12 years of Minecraft!

I LOVE IT!!!,"I’ve been playing Subway Surfers since I was a little kid and practically grew up with it. Even now I think it’s such a fun and exciting game. It definitely can help pass time. Two really cool characters I would LOVE to have you guys bring back is Mimi and Rabbot. I missed both of them and couldn’t get a chance to have them as characters. Speaking of Mimi, if I’m correct she does have a pet otter which is super cute. I don’t know if the otter runs with her when she is trying to evade the inspector, but if it does I think that the Subway Surfers team should have a pet isle where players can choose an animal to run with them like the inspector has a dog. I would absolutely DIE if that could happen. I also definitely think that younger players would enjoy this. Please consider because I think it will definitely draw more attention to this amazing game. Besides that I think this game has amazing graphics and deserves to have “hype” I also like how you guys make different maps that represent different parts of the world. Anyway I said this already but please consider my suggestion. Not forcing you but I think that it will be a great addition to this outstanding game.

It sounds crazy, but I almost wish it was back to the days when you lived off of cows and used boats, but now it’s all cheats and crazy builds and bees. But my favorite part has to be the soundtrack. Listening to these songs, all the memories flow in and rush back, and I think about my brother and cousin building a mansion, and me begging to play, or when my brother would still play with me. This game was my childhood. And while everyone else is crooning over Fortnite, Minecraft remains the best. The music is just magnificent. But, there are a few things that need fixing. Whenever I get on, it says there was an account error, and I don’t even have an account. Also, I made a few characters and they fail to load. Finally, I just wish on Pocket Edition you could go back to different updates so I could play like I used to; no bees, no dolphins, no crazy stuff - just how the game started out. For me, listening to the soundtrack and the scent of Winter Candy Apple by Bath and Body Works brings back all the memories. Minecraft will always be with us.

That’s why this and every other game like it has such a low win ratio (stars & coins).  They are out for your real life dollars, and don’t give a rats tail about what you think or comments you make.  That’s how our society and economy work.  You want to progress quicker... pay up.  The only way you can change it is to not spend the money.  Money or lack there of is what gets their attention nothing else.  They will never read this or any other comment.

I have a few suggestions for things you could add or fix. My first thing and biggest thing is a friends list because sometimes when your playing you meet this awesome person but then one of you have to go and you will never see that person that you bonded with again. Another thing is new colors, hats, and pets. I think there should be a wider variety of colors including gray, dark red, light purple, and a tie color could be awesome! There should be additional hats added as well like a set of head phones, glasses, new wigs, and a set of pretty wings. I also think that there should be more pets and pets that you don’t have to pay for or like watch a certain amount of adds to unlock this pet or do this to unlock this pet. I think they should add a poddle pet, cat, and a bird would be cool. Something that kinda bothers me is that Mirah HQ (probably spelled wrong) doesn’t have cameras in it. I have also encountered some people who have asked sexual questions and wanted to do sexual activity I know that you can’t really do anything about that but I wanted to put that out there.

A friend of mine can no longer even load the game to play our world together. It's upsetting. It's truly upsetting. The game lags and my world's so corrupted entire chunks glitch out. I don't like it anymore. And no company should ever send out an update that they know has problems they have to acknowledge in the update notice. That's just uncalled for.

Also, can you add a new character: Toon Bot?Toon Bot would be the normal robot body, like tagbot and tankbot,Just a few design changes. For the head, it would be a screen like a TV, changing facial expressions. The TV head would glitch, or bug out whenever the player is caught or damaged. The second costume for Toonbot would be a retro, video game style with a more modern, clean tv instead of an old, 1990 style tv. It would come with a new board witch would simply be a TV remote, special purchasable powers for the board would be zap sideways and super speed. This might add a but of modern-day style to the game.

Not that they’re not working extra hard to make you do it... When I started playing, it was fun because I always had a chance to win. The kite will do what it’s supposed to and the bombs won’t go and destroy the next move. The rocket with a kite won’t go and clear the row with already a rocket in it, thus ruining 2 rockets. Decorating wasn’t as hard either. You didn’t need a star to make every call and 2 stars for a rehearsal. Around level 900 it started getting frustrating and I stopped for a while. A few months ago I started playing and nothing is the same. The power ups are there to ruin your game. One has to depend on luck than tact to win. It’s now designed to eat all your hammers, kites, gloves etc but still won’t let you win. If I was frustrated before, I’m finding it hard to express myself now. Ofcourse the proportion of coins you win to the stars you earn was always unfair but atleast I knew that in every game there would be some move and a definite chance to win. They want you to buy coins, I get it, they are after all here for the money. But looks like they’re taking away the fun factor away from the game which for me has been the biggest disappointment.

I deleted it after reaching level 20. The reason I deleted it is because it’s too boring to me. It was interesting fixing up the house but having to use multiple stars for some aspects and even to move to the next day is greedy. The bank I despised. Good premise but it holds coins you earn hostage unless you pay to buy it once you accumulate 3000 or 5000 coins. There is no choice either, you watch your coins disappear. The small mini games shown in the ads are the best part but they are way too few and far between. The majority of this game is playing levels over and over trying to get the next star to fix the never ending repairs. I also found having to use stars to open packages annoying. If I’m getting a gift it should be just. There is some humor and the scenes are colorful which is why i gave it two stars. Had the earning of coins been much higher, the mini games much more prevalent, the bank either free to obtain or at least an option, the limiting of one star per repair and not having to use stars on anything other than repairs I could have seen playing this longer. I tried these match three types of games several times now and always delete them quickly once the repetition of levels hits.

One thing everyone should know unequivocally before beginning, however, is that the developers hate the players. Hate may not even be a strong enough word for it. I could be wrong, maybe it’s impossible to fairly balance a puzzle game but to program it so much in the favor of you losing is... unsurprising considering how often it wants you to purchase things. Now, you don’t have ads in this game, which is nice, and the options to purchase don’t ensure victory (I mean at all), so in a sense the game is consistent and there’s some comfort in that. The reward system is pretty rough, it does sometimes feel like an endless attempt to wear you down. You will rage quit from time to time, or put it down for a couple months, but this is a casual game. Whereas other games make me feel as if they’ve earned my business, I find the challenge of this one is seeing how far I can go without spending any money, because it tries so hard. It’s my tiny moral victory.

The game is also very predictable. If you build properties the next roll the next player almost every time won't land on you. I like the game, however another issue is that it freezes up at crucial junctures of the game. Such as after a trade. You have no choice after several minutes to abandon the game. Very frustrating after vesting so much time into it. Also I just finished a game & I bankrupted every player then it announced the last bankrupted player as the “winner!”. Ticks you off especially after spending an hour with idiots that want to make the same trade every single turn!

It’s just so fun and addicting. I just got it about three weeks ago and I haven’t stopped playing since. Although it’s a very well made very fun to play game, there’s some things that I think would be cool to add either to among us or among us 2. 1. There should be a way to kick people faster if you’re the host during a game. Some people like to call emergency meetings and waste time, so being able to kick them out would make it go by way faster. 2. I think it would be awesome to add a send a friend request button. Some people have really good friendships on here and a lot of the time one of them might disconnect or have to go and never see each other again! ;( If we had a add friend button, we could always play with them. Plus, when you try to give your personal number or social media’s out to someone, the whole server can see it unless you ban them all. 3. I think I saw this on another review, but maybe add a limit to camera time? It’s kinda hard to kill when people are guarding the cameras. 4. Hackers and exploiters should be automatically banned from playing. Maybe you could install a thing that detects their programming and stuff? They ruin the game a lot. Other than that, this game is amazing! Definitely game of the year.

I’ve played many games, but this one has become my favorite. Over time though, I am beginning to get frustrated!

I don’t even know what’s after that, because it’s just so much! Even with the rewards they grant, you only get 100 coins which is like nothing. You really have to spend money to play this game. I’ve tried to be patient and play the games out without spending money, but many levels you just can’t! I don’t mind spending the money here and there, but it’s so expensive, it doesn’t even make it worth it. You get 1000 coins for .99 and it takes 900 coins to get 5 extra turns. That adds up really quick! Plus it’s even more expensive if you want power ups! I’m not too sure how much more I can continue playing if they don’t make some changes. It’s beginning to add up with how many coins I’ve been buying just to beat rounds. On top of that I believe that there are also sometimes when the board isn’t applying the power ups correctly.

What if there was a role called “Jester” where their goal is to get ejected, making them win? Sounds like it could be a hit or miss, but I think that’d be cool. Also a role of “Detective” sounds interesting. Like, you can give that person the option to take screenshots, so they can have solid alibis/evidence of the imposter, but only they have it, so that the crew mates don’t have too much of an advantage. They can send the screenshots to the chat, helping out their case (maybe also a limited amount of screenshots so their not overpowered?). Also the idea of adding friends would be cool! It’s sad you can’t add anyone, and the strangers you could enjoy playing with you’ll only play with once. It would also be nice to adopt mini crew mates whenever their parent dies, I just think that would be very wholesome.

Then...it got harder and harder to pass levels. I have little money to spend so I rarely buy “helps” but I do write reviews when I love a game and tell friends to check it out. I haven’t played Gardenscapes for weeks now—though I sometimes open it up to look at how pretty the garden is and to tell Austin I’m still on vacation and to take care of the house. With the Homescapes game I am enjoying a feeling of accomplishment again but I assume that too will soon end. I think the developers have made it way too hard to make any progress that the discouragement way outweighs any fun. Why not give us a way to earn more points (rather than watching commercials about other games—and even that doesn’t get you much)? I almost deleted Gardenscapes last week I was so frustrated.

I refresh the servers, and there’s barely any. I try another one, same problem. I’m usually spending at least 2-3 minutes just trying to join a game with settings I like.

Another suggestion is more customization, there’s only 12 colors along with a not so massive selection of hats. I’m not allowed to buy anything online, so it would be cool for more customization for people that can’t afford to buy more hats and things! My final suggestion is MORE GAMEMODES!!!

The only time something really weird happened was when somebody with a weird name had tried to get us to follow his/her Twitter, but thanks to the new update Among Us blocks your ability to redirect to another website in the chat. Here’s the thing though. Recently, I ran into another one of the weird-named people, and they said in the chat that the lobby was hacked and he/she had all of the players’ IP addresses. This was an empty threat, as IP addresses are public knowledge (and you can’t find out where you are based on them)and Apple phones are virtually impossible to hack. However, this really shook me up and I deleted Among Us immediately. I didn’t want to be hacked. EVER. It was kind of scary even though I knew the extensive anti-hacking measures taken place by InnerSloth (the game’s creator).

I also feel like since people can lie about their age, and it isn’t fair to us as kids to let older people be able to say what they want when it seems like they do the most cursing, maybe people can report others that cuss so they would have to use the quick chat for a month or so, since another problem is that it only stops the kids from cursing and explicit stuff, they can still see what other people do if they don’t have censor chat on. As a result of this, in addition to the above suggestion, make it so that the quick chat is an option available, not an unfamiliar thing forced upon us kids.

I look forward to more updates like the nether update, although not any that are too massive, because people like me (and there are a lot of us) don’t want to lose the simplicity of Minecraft we grew up with. We all want improvements (bug fixes and Java parity specifically on this version) but we don’t massive changes that make Minecraft unrecognizable. For example, the cave update everyone wants, every one expects a massive change but don’t realize it would completely strip Minecraft if it’s simple mining aspect. I am probably the only person in the world who doesn’t want a cave update, but I just don’t want Minecraft to become something else.

But you reach a certain point where you have to have boosters to beat the levels, & because Playtrix only gives you a max of 70 coins for each level beat (a taudry amount considering what things cost in the game), you end up spending  your own money  to be able to keep playing levels, or to be able to buy boosters to beat the levels. To break it down for you: I’m at level 122 (which is impossible to beat without a booster because of how it is set up), which is about midway through the 5th decoration level in the game (haven’t even broached the upstairs level yet). I’ve already spent $60 on coins/boosters, & I’ve only been playing 2 weeks. Not going to spend anymore $ on this (even though I enjoy it) simply on principle. The rewards for levels are not anywhere close to what they should be, & the amounts you get for what you pay for aren’t enough either. In other games if you spent $20 you would be set for a couple weeks. This game ends up being a days at most because of demand for boosters/coins to the cost ratio.

I think you guy wanted to spice things up and I think some people like it but I could be nice if you would change it back to the old version or at least I have a control in the settings to change it to any version you want.

They don’t have to be perfect, as you can still play the game without problems. I have tried programming before and it IS NOT EASY. I would like to give a shoutout to whoever made this game because it is fabulous, no matter what others say.I do think that the characters are a little over priced, but that is just me. I do like how there are lots of ways to earn the money for them. (Play the game itself, watch adds, get mystery boxes, ETC.)Maybe you could add a feature where you could sign in with another account. I get that you don’t need an account to play (And that is great!) but my favorite character, Tagbot, is on my other device.

The story lines are cute as well.  Some of the story items cost way too much compared other games and honestly nothing should cost more than 2 stars, let alone stuff that costs 6.  That’s ridiculous and no other game does it.Speaking of... so when you have to clear 6 game boards to complete a story line task, every one counts, and often you may use a booster for that last piece with your last move.  Only on occasion, when the board is NOT MOVING, an airplane will go take out some random piece that has nothing to do with advancing the game.  You lose a life, and they start to back you into a corner where you need to use coins.  It’s cheating.  I contacted Support and their response?  Lol “The way the game works.....”  sooooo, i understand how the game works, I’m close to level 3,000.... not what I stated the issue is.  They never addressed the issue and simply kept saying that I don’t know how to play.  They slid me a couple of boosters to “lightening my day”, whatever that is, and even said at that time “this wasn’t our fault but here are a couple of boosters to lightening you day”.  Extremely frustrating that they didn’t even acknowledge a possible issue.... not even a “let us look into it”.  Whatever.... I still play but I refuse to buy coins.

However, I would really like to see some better incentives to keep players in the game. For some of the side challenges (e.g. knitting), the rewards, such as unlimited lives for a certain period of time, are given immediately. If I had the option to save that reward for a rainy day, perhaps when I’m tackling a particularly difficult level, I’d be more inclined to play for longer periods of time. When this happens, however, it’s almost always the case that I don’t have the time to actually use said reward and it ends up being useless. I’d also like to see the coin rewards have a better balance. 50-70 coins as a reward for each level won? Come on! What about an additional ten or so coins for each remaining turn? Say if I’ve beaten a level and I have five turns left. I should win the base coins of fifty and then an additional fifty for each turn I didn’t use. For harder levels, base coins of 100 and then an additional fifty coins for each additional remaining turn. Now THAT’S an incentive! That would be rad. Otherwise, fun game!","However, I would really like to see some better incentives to keep players in the game.",4,True,effectiveness,positive,2

Be that you or another computer generated player.   I addressed this privately with specifics before coming back and rewriting the review.

For example, every task around the house goes from costing one star to two. The rewards aren’t sufficient to the amount of boosts being spent on harder levels. Some levels are so hard and waste so many lives that you have to use boosts just to get through it. There should be more levels that don’t take multiple tries to get through. Some of the tasks that the game makes you do are stupid. The game is trying to get you to use all your stars so you have to play more, which is typical, but with the levels so hard, it’s really just a tactic to get people to spend more money. It’s also takes way too long for the lives to reload. It’s like 25mins per life. I really liked this game at the start but the further I’ve gotten, the less I want to continue playing. Instead of throwing in so many different aspects into the puzzle games so soon, they should have waited and made it harder much later. I’m only in the kitchen and I spend on average 3-5 lives on each level. I try not to use boosters because they are so hard to earn. Paying 900coins to get 5 more moves on one level, when each level earns you roughly 50-70 coins (hard levels earn you 100+) is just sad. In conclusion, this game only remains fun for the first 60 levels then gets frustrating. Pretty much a scheme to get consumers to spend a lot of money.",The rewards aren’t sufficient to the amount of boosts being spent on harder levels.,2,True,enjoyability,positive,4

I first saw it played on Twitch and said I have got to experience this. The graphics, animation and modeling are really fun. Based on old reviews, I think many issues from the past are solved. The network seems reliable and the rules and variations are pretty much on point. The AI players add a new dimension. They are annoying at worst and a wonderful addition for shrewd dealing humans, at best. The klunky repetitious and nonsensical “offers” they make are pretty bad. And the fact that they only assess deals based on value of the deeds and classifying them as “easy, medium, or hard” just improves their luck and reduces yours makes them pretty frustrating at times. But they’re fun to push around and like I said, they create a whole new dimension in game play. Imagine making a deal with a predictable robot to mess up your human opponent, etc. That said, the overall game feels cold and lonely. How do we know we are really playing against a human when we join Multiplayer online? What is our own record of wins and losses? What if we want to play against a particular player again?

This is unfortunate for a game that requires a decent time investment to complete. I also find myself wondering what happens when a player decides to quit. Is that why the game freezes?

However I did find more cons than pros. Let’s start off with finding a server. You have three different maps to choose from. You can also choose if you want to play with 1, 2, or 3 imposters. The imposter’s job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with “Confirm Ejects” and “Visual Tasks” on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says “(insert anything here) was not An Imposter” or “was An Imposter”. With it being the imposter’s job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! This game is ruled by immature 12 year olds and when they get accused, they break lose. I am not exaggerating, I have heard the N word, the F word, and so many other ridiculously bad and racist words in this game than I did in the real world.

Very disappointed in this product, it could have been a decent way to play while away from my computer but so far it’s been literally nothing but wasted phone memory. Fix your app Mojang.

It’s so fun and the strategy involved makes it more exciting to play. It also gives such a rush of adrenaline. But whilst this game is structured beautifully and an incredible game, I do have a few small tips that I think could make this game better than it already is. First of all, an add friend button. Me and my friends love playing servers together and being able to friend other users could make it easier to game together. Also a microphone feature would be great. Chatting with the other users whilst playing out loud could be really great, because you’d be talking instead of typing through a screen. You’d be able to pick a game with microphone chatting or without, just whatever you prefer personally. Also being to branch out into private chats with people in the server would be really good. That way you could discuss plans with fellow imposters and win in a better and more strategized way. Also you could chat with friends you’re playing with separately. It would add a better feature of strategy and even betrayal to the game. You could even use it for persuasion purposes. Those are a few small but very effective features I think us among us users would love and highly appreciate! Thank you for this amazing game and I hope you take into account these suggestions!",It’s so fun and the strategy involved makes it more exciting to play.,5,True,enjoyability,positive,4

When I saw the advertisement for this game it seemed like it would be so fun so after getting the game it is not what the advertising said at all! It said I would have a room with a fire going, a sink flooding water every where, mice running around, and a broken microwave. At the bottom of the screen there were options of what you need to do first, what you need to use to fix it, and if you choose the wrong thing you lose. It said why is this game so hard. Dumping a gasoline can onto a fire causes you to lose. This game is nothing like they advertised so that was a huge let down. Other than that, the game is fun. I like the switching tiles game to earn points and I like to redecorate the house. I wish it only took one star to finish a task instead of needing 3-4 stars to find the scarecrows causing the problem, build a scare crow, scare the crows off, etc. many different things are that way.

Now all the ads I see for this game don't make sense. I see some where the main characters are trapped on an island and they are being attacked by a shark, some where they are stranded in the cold and freezing, and within the last couple days I saw two more that DONT MAKE SENSE! The guy has to pee and he’s running down the hall and things are breaking. Then the reason I wrote this review is because I was so confused and disturbed by the one I just saw: the guy has his hands and feet tied to bed posts and the room is on fire and he wants to escape.

I try to spread positivity in the chat reassuring people that it’s just a game no need to get mad. But... when I do I just get called racial slurs, homophobic slurs, and horrible names in general. When joining a game on WiFi it will keep saying unable to connect. And it is too hard to kick people from games especially when everyone has to vote for them to leave.

If I did and they deleted everything then that would mean I just spent and wasted a whole lot of money. And I’m pretty sure that is what happened to other people who bought stuff using real money. Another thing is the design. It’s not that great. The graphics and layout are really childish. And now for some reason the game takes FOREVER to load.

I also like the magnet power up because you can get all the coins for a couple seconds without crashing. I also like how you can get keys.  Keys are things that are hard to get but you can get a lot of stuff with them like outfits and hoverboards.  For example, you can get characters with them.  I also like how you can get keys by doing stuff like getting 810 coins in one run you can get 8 keys.  Last of all, I like how you can watch videos to get things.  For example, you can watch a video every day to get two keys and you can also get super mystery boxes by watching videos too.  Last, I like  if you are at 0 coins or 0 keys, you can watch videos nonstop and get 10 keys in 15 minutes or get 10,000 coins in 20 minutes.  As you can see this is a very good game.

Every time u think your finally done with the outside theirs something stupid you have to still do.

But ever since Character Creator has been added to the game, my custom skins have been looking off. I use slim-armed skins because I prefer them over classic skins but the glitch only occurs on slim-armed skins. Let’s say you have a slim-armed skin, and you wanted a unique design on each leg. Like different-lengthened socks, or a flower on one and a star on the other. Then when you upload the skin on the game, whatever way you designed the right leg (it looks like the left leg if you look straight at the skin) gets copy and pasted automatically onto the left leg (right leg if you look at the skin straight at the face). It looks distorted, as I don’t know if other players can or cannot see the error besides yourself, but it’s basically both legs are symmetrical while a lot of skin designers like not making symmetrical, and the second layer on the leg that gets changed to looking like the other stays. So basically the glitched leg looks exactly like the other leg that looks perfectly fine, but has second layer on it. Like then both legs would have like a flower on it but the star’s second layer is stuck on top of the copy and pasted flower. Pretty odd right? For me it makes me feel like I have OCD, I can’t stand skins that have something off on it, sorry. It doesn’t do the glitch on classic skins though.

It is a great game to play with friends and just play in your free time. I love being the imposter and being a crewmate is just as fun. Though, so people have been hacking the game and choosing who the imposter is, walking outside the ship, and sabotaging when they are even not a crewmate. (By the way, crewmates cannot sabotage.) It makes the game a little less fun, but it is still great. Though, recently, they updated it so that in the chat, you cannot say things that you want to say and instead you can only say stuff like “Blah is the imposter!” or “Blah vented!” (The imposter can go though vents to travel faster.) It is WAY more confusing than the older version and it makes it a little less enjoyable. When I couldn’t figure out how to operate the chat to say something, people assumed I was the imposter and voted me out. (You can vote people out if people vote them out.) I know that they did this so that it can be safer so that people don’t say bad words, but it is difficult.

I am not rating it based on gameplay, because that would mean that it would be five stars. My  2 star review is because of the community. Now, the reason it’s not 1 Star is because I met some really good people. Like IJevI, they were kind, friendly, and nice. They wouldn’t even kill me if he was the impostor. He would legit kill everyone else and leave me be. So I did the same. But on the other hand, ITS RADIOACTIVE ☢️ X TOXIC X 1,000,000. I’ve seen people being racist, trolls, hackers, cheaters, discord tryhards (people who cheat by letting their friend get killed and their friend tells them who it is), and more. That is absolutely unacceptable. I am not giving up among us, just warning y’all of the murky waters ahead if you get this. Add friend system!!! I want friend system!!! Don’t do so in the next update, and I am telling my friends it’s a bad game, it is sparse in terms of account management (cuz there is no account managements or accounts at all) it has a toxic community, and can have bad connections sometimes. Edit: well, thanks for adding anonymous options! It will help a lot in games. I also appreciate you adding symbols to the wires for those colorblind people. Still, add a friend system. I really want to add my friends. You need to fix this. I meet new and kind people. Develop friendship. They only last a day. 😞😞😞",I meet new and kind people.,3,True,general,positive,5

Now I think this could be a good idea, but I have to disagree. You see I think this will discourage players to use the regular typing chat we already have, and for players that A. aren’t allowed to talk to strangers. And B. Don’t have a mic, or just are in a crowded room, would not be able to experience the game! Because if they couldn’t use the voice chat they wouldn’t be able to hear or talk because everyone would be using the voice chat, the regular chat would be obsolete. And that would make those people stop playing among us! Which would not be very helpful to your company. Also I have read about the hide and seek mode, and really think that should be added along with other modes; because the game as is, gets boring after a month or so. Personally I haven’t played this game in months because of the lack of variety, I also think a friend system is the #1 thing you need right now because when players who have bonded over a few games are lost to each other forever when they quit/disconnect. All in all it is a very good game with neat gameplay, I just think you need to think about your future because even a game this fun can die fast. Definitely recommend.",Which would not be very helpful to your company.,5,True,general,negative,5

If you can imagine it build it, not only does it show how creative you can be but also make you get more ideas, it’s almost an addictive cycle. Weird I know I took a break from this game for a year and then boom out of no where blew up.  I would always love to think back to 2011 to when I enjoyed this game on an old pc at my grandparents. Now I can’t stop playing it. All I can say is thank you, bringing us entertainment for all these years. This game has been there sense the start and came out rough into the best sandbox game I have ever played. Sure there are some negatives about the game, like you can’t get custom skins off files on Xbox without having to decrepit the games files. I always had used MCPE skin creator/editor and it worked amazingly but sad to know I can only do it on mobile. But put that aside, and you have an overall 90/10 game right now for me it’s perfect as it is. Sadly the original creators of Minecraft are gone and now bough by another company, if your reading this you might say, the new company is bad. But what they did to the game is so amazing, doing more than the original game designers would to with it.

I play to earn the keys and coins through the challenges they give.  And will spend an hour of playing. Using all the available means they give to multiply your scores and boost yourself.  And it simply just takes too much gameplay to earn what they are charging for the items in the store.   You want to just charge me $9.99 for the full game and release most boards and outfits to me.

It is really hard to play the game with a chat limit. I do like that there isn’t anymore swearing because I was getting tired of that, but if there was a wider selection and easier ways to find things, that would be great!! I know this was for a good reason and it was meant to make things easier, but it really doesn’t. Maybe if you let people type in some things but not everything like ‘you are an idiot!’ that would be double awesome!!

I will still play this game because I really love the idea of it though!!

I noticed that I would strive to get my pink and dark blue set every game, but nobody would land on them once I added houses and/or hotels. I noticed that they would skate right by and all of a sudden I keep going to jail when no player had been the entire game. After 30+ games, you start to notice trends. Today was kind of the breaking point for me when an AI owned Park Place and nobody owned Boardwalk. This was the beginning of the game and neither I nor the 3 AI’s had more than 2 or 3 properties and nobody was close to a set. I offered everything I had plus ONE THOUSAND dollars and the AI refused my trade. The next turn he rolled, landed on Boardwalk, completed the set, and put several houses on each. I’m pretty intelligent and am very good at recognizing patterns.

I have phases where I will play it 24/7 and days where I don’t even want to open the app and if I do I shut it out and change my mind. However, I love this game. I love the characters, the season hunts, and challenges. The one thing. The ONE THING that I cannot stand are the super sneakers. I hate how bulky they are and how they make me feel like I’m moving slow. I also can’t stand the magnetic ability in them. Don’t get me wrong, it does come in handy, but when I’m mid-jump and they run out of the little bar thing at the bottom (idk what it’s called), the charge of them if you will, and I’m going over a jump with coins and the sneakers run out and i’m left in the air not getting the remainder of the coins...that makes me so unbelievably annoyed. I could care less about the sneakers. In fact, I try to avoid them as much as I possibly can and when I do accidentally get them, I sigh and roll my eyes.

However I did find more cons than pros. Let’s start off with finding a server. You have three different maps to choose from. You can also choose if you want to play with 1, 2, or 3 imposters. The imposter’s job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with “Confirm Ejects” and “Visual Tasks” on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says “(insert anything here) was not An Imposter” or “was An Imposter”. With it being the imposter’s job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! This game is ruled by immature 12 year olds and when they get accused, they break lose. I am not exaggerating, I have heard the N word, the F word, and so many other ridiculously bad and racist words in this game than I did in the real world. The N word is a word that you will encounter. People think it’s okay if they leave the hard r out but it’s not. The N word is probably the most popular word in this game.

I mean I’m trying to make faces with text and it doesn’t let me. Mostly it would just make talking with others more fun. Number two is microphone. We should be able to make the settings of a game to be microphone only because honestly it’s easier and takes less time to talk. Number three hide and seek game mode.

Now I’m not complaining that mobile players get updates later I’m just saying that at the time I’m typing this everyday I get into an among us lobby at least once it says I need to update and then I go to the App Store and I can’t update. Now I don’t know how updates for this game work since I’ve never experienced an actual update for it before.

This really makes me mad and frustrated because of how many times it’s happened. Next, there is a hacker. You will join a game and the screen will be all black and you can free run wherever. Then when you check the chat it has a link telling you random stuff and to vote for trump. This can be really scary for young ones and we should also not bring any thing political into a game that kids are playing for fun. Also, in the text it says it will hack with your WiFi. Which is true, not for me, but people I know. It logs them out of their WiFi and disconnects them where they can or rejoin. I would really recommend to wait to download the app until these bugs have been fixed. Thankfully, they have said that instead of making an “Amomg us #2” they will wait of and be trying to fix these bugs instead.

EG, if trading cards, reasoning for trades or refuse etc. that would be like the actual game and that will add the excitement in playing. Also, themes, boards, and tokens are way expensive. Would be nice since the game itself is paid, features should be lesser the price and not higher than the actual game. Lastly, on that note i wish there is an option to add the player as a friend for future game.

Though, recently, they updated it so that in the chat, you cannot say things that you want to say and instead you can only say stuff like “Blah is the imposter!” or “Blah vented!” (The imposter can go though vents to travel faster.) It is WAY more confusing than the older version and it makes it a little less enjoyable. When I couldn’t figure out how to operate the chat to say something, people assumed I was the imposter and voted me out. (You can vote people out if people vote them out.) I know that they did this so that it can be safer so that people don’t say bad words, but it is difficult. Also, I know that the people who made among us cannot change this, but could you at least put “I am having trouble using the chat,” or something like that? Overall, I think that it is a great game and I absolutely recommend it. Thank you for reading my review and I hope that you consider playing the game. 🙂",I love being the imposter and being a crewmate is just as fun.,4,True,enjoyability,positive,4

There is one thing that I loved about the old one that this new one doesn’t have and that’s is: while you are playing you could look and see how much % chance this certain lot would be landed on and by whom. For example, when I’m trying to build a house I’d look and see if the cat coming down the road would land on either Baltic Ave or Boardwalk, and the one with the greater % I’d build the house on.

Not matter your trying to survive the night with your friends in survival, or building the mansion of your dreams in creative, best game ive ever played and has sculpted me as a gamer and in real life from the way I think of architecture and design. I can still remember being scared out my socks when I was only a kindle fire and it was day in the desert, and I went into a cave, then it was pitch black, I started to spin, and then I was lost. No escape. I was in survival for the first time which made it worse. Then Im spinning trying to see a light going deeper and deeper and BOOM! Got blown up by a creeper, let’s say I stuck to creative for a bit lol 😂. I love going on the MC discord and looking at all the amazing feedback I get from other players now that I have some actual good idea of what I’m doing and I’m trying to figure out redstone. One thing I would suggest, stop advertising the game as a game for little kids because even though I’m a kid I know when I’m an adult if you keep updating I’ll still be playing!

I do not recall anyone who has this problem that I know, but that is because most of my friends do not play Subway surfers. There is also a problem with the new “tankbot”. I purchased him a day ago and it was a waste of my time and money. It took me forever to purchase this character because it said “loading”. But it took me about 10 minutes to get this character and use it for the first time because of this purchase. Tank bot also crashed every time and my phone froze completely. When it unfroze and I played again, it happened again. I do not remember this happening when I use Zoey or any of the other characters. Please fix that and if you do, I will give a better review.

One of my biggest complaints is the fact that you cannot do something as little as pull down your notification screen a smidge without being forced to bear a 20 second+ dimmed out “Rejoining game...” screen. That’s ridiculous. Why should it take that long to get back in the game when I hardly even left? The connection errors/bugs are ridiculous and make it rare to get a solid game in. That’s unacceptable, really. What’s the point in playing a game that’s likely to crash because of bugs? Also, the lack of any form of communication between players is upsetting. Seriously, no chat box? No ability to use our microphones? You want to charge $4 for a board game and not let us speak to each other? They’re also charging $30 for a season pass that I believe features strictly cosmetics. 🙄 Marmalade, if you want our money at least give us a solid game. Another complaint I have is the only games rules we have to choose from are: Classic and Quick mode. It would be nice to have the options to change the rules/play custom games and whatnot. To the Monopoly fans, tread carefully because this game was clearly developed as a cash grab and not to give us the mobile Monopoly we would expect in 2020.

No big deal, it’s something that can happen sometimes and I can just join right back in. But after 5 minutes it did it again. Then again. And again.

We were stuck in this complicated dance for over an hour before we decided to call it quits out of utter frustration. There is no way this could just be my internet. Not only was I mere inches away from the router but I was the only one in my house. Nobody else was connected to the internet but me so why did I keep getting booted out of the server?

It’s super fun even when your not playing with friends. I know many people have an opinion on this (most of them good) so I just thought I spread the word even more. I feel like you should really add a friend system! That way you can send friend requests to people you would like to join’s game. Something that I find very annoying, is when your in the middle of playing, then get kicked out and it says: “Sent 6 pings” or the “unreliable packet source” or something. Its really annoying how you can be playing and then boom. Back to the main menu you go! So that’s something I would like if you fixed it. And finally, the trolls. I hate when people will join a game and ask “hey any (insert gender) here?” “What’s ur snap?” “Hey how old are you?” It’s really uncomfortable. Also when people say inappropriate things like private things to other strangers. It gets me disgusted. So I thought something thst could help with that is banning. If someone is beign really rude,or innapropriate I (and many others) would appreciate it if the game can ban them for maybe 30 minutes. So they can still play, but it’s later. Like a punishment for acting however they did. But I cannot say that this game is bad. I am really enjoying the newest update very much!

I find them to be fun and even addicting. Although the concept of the game is great, and I’ve only been playing for a short while, something needs to be improved with the coin/lives system. Getting around 50 coins per mini-game, which can take multiple lives to complete, isn’t sufficient enough. In order to buy a life, 900 coins, you would have to play around 18 rounds just to get enough coins for ONE life. I do not pay money on games, never have never will, but it’s so frustrating that you may have one move left and instead of paying real cash, not in game coins, you have to wait for a life to replenish just to try and fail at the level again. Each round can take 10+ lives to complete, and it takes quite awhile for the lives to replenish. There should be some kind of reward opportunity other than completing a day, especially because you need to play the mini-games to get stars, in order to complete tasks, to complete the day. That’s a lot of tasks to do with not a lot of lives/coin rewards!!! If there were events where you can play other mini-games to gain rewards/treasures I think it would be more efficient. I also think 28 minutes is a long time to wait for one single life.

That was before level 1913. I liked it because I could always advance. Beating difficult levels may have taken MULTIPLE attempts but didn’t require having to spend money. However, within the game there are weekly contests where you’re placed on teams. The better you do the higher your team level placement. When you’re ranked in the lower levels I’m convinced this game randomly “loosens up” and you’re able to go on winning streaks (doing so allows you to accumulate coins to help Austin fix the house, which is the point of the game, right?). Likewise, I’m convinced when you do well and find yourself in a higher level, the game “tightens up” and it’s impossible to win any level without spending coin, either real or earned. When I got to level 1913 I got placed in the highest ranking level. Since then I have not been able to get, even close, to beating a level without earning enough extra coins (by watching ads, etc.) to buy my way through. It takes a looooong time to earn those coins!

However I did find more cons than pros. Let’s start off with finding a server. You have three different maps to choose from. You can also choose if you want to play with 1, 2, or 3 imposters. The imposter’s job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with “Confirm Ejects” and “Visual Tasks” on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says “(insert anything here) was not An Imposter” or “was An Imposter”. With it being the imposter’s job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! This game is ruled by immature 12 year olds and when they get accused, they break lose. I am not exaggerating, I have heard the N word, the F word, and so many other ridiculously bad and racist words in this game than I did in the real world.

The kite will do what it’s supposed to and the bombs won’t go and destroy the next move. The rocket with a kite won’t go and clear the row with already a rocket in it, thus ruining 2 rockets. Decorating wasn’t as hard either. You didn’t need a star to make every call and 2 stars for a rehearsal. Around level 900 it started getting frustrating and I stopped for a while. A few months ago I started playing and nothing is the same. The power ups are there to ruin your game. One has to depend on luck than tact to win. It’s now designed to eat all your hammers, kites, gloves etc but still won’t let you win. If I was frustrated before, I’m finding it hard to express myself now. Ofcourse the proportion of coins you win to the stars you earn was always unfair but atleast I knew that in every game there would be some move and a definite chance to win. They want you to buy coins, I get it, they are after all here for the money. But looks like they’re taking away the fun factor away from the game which for me has been the biggest disappointment. This was a good game, very addictive and fun. It’s getting hard to say that that is true anymore.","I’ve been playing this game for a while and am at level 1700+ Full disclosure, I’ve never spent any real money on this game.",2,True,enjoyability,positive,4

If I did and they deleted everything then that would mean I just spent and wasted a whole lot of money. And I’m pretty sure that is what happened to other people who bought stuff using real money. Another thing is the design. It’s not that great. The graphics and layout are really childish. And now for some reason the game takes FOREVER to load.

The chances for triple doubles are extremely high when you put it against the odds from doing some simple math. After the building phase, everybody just goes to jail most of the time. It’s almost impossible to play with conventional Monopoly techniques because of the rigged chances of the dice, and having to deal with random obnoxious bots online, even if you chose to play with real people. This game has too many bugs and too few features. Online Multiplayer never works, they’ve got tons of bots and it always freezes, forcing all players to force quit the game. The animation is also way too long and it’s been frustratingly improbable trying to play with others online. And the fact that the game is server-sided does not change the developers’ minds to at least rent a competent server, because from what I’ve witnessed throughout the last few months, the servers have been utter trash. And the monopoly Hasbro has over this game makes this distillation of laziness and greed the only game of its kind on App Store, leaving you no choices but to buy it if you want to play this 100-year-old board game.

The hoverboard mechanic was very responsive even at the higher speed late game. The physics were doing great for a game, but now the hoverboard lags at times, I was in a super late game run where I attempted to activate the hoverboard and it didn’t work until my 4th attempt at double tapping. This wouldn’t have been an issue in the previous update. Also, the roofs can end your game even with a hoverboard? I have the monster board with the high jump ability and I made it admittedly higher than expected, but I just expected to lose the board and continue, but no it killed me entirely. The previous update where I did the same just passed me through no worries. If this is for added difficulty, I guess I can understand, but the fluidity the game once had is gone.

Don’t get me wrong, it does come in handy, but when I’m mid-jump and they run out of the little bar thing at the bottom (idk what it’s called), the charge of them if you will, and I’m going over a jump with coins and the sneakers run out and i’m left in the air not getting the remainder of the coins...that makes me so unbelievably annoyed. I could care less about the sneakers. In fact, I try to avoid them as much as I possibly can and when I do accidentally get them, I sigh and roll my eyes. My brother is the same way, and so are many other people. I want something better, or make it so the sneakers magnetic ability don’t stop picking up the coins when i’m mid-air. Thank you, goodnight.","I love the characters, the season hunts, and challenges.",4,True,general,positive,5

I find them to be fun and even addicting. Although the concept of the game is great, and I’ve only been playing for a short while, something needs to be improved with the coin/lives system. Getting around 50 coins per mini-game, which can take multiple lives to complete, isn’t sufficient enough. In order to buy a life, 900 coins, you would have to play around 18 rounds just to get enough coins for ONE life. I do not pay money on games, never have never will, but it’s so frustrating that you may have one move left and instead of paying real cash, not in game coins, you have to wait for a life to replenish just to try and fail at the level again. Each round can take 10+ lives to complete, and it takes quite awhile for the lives to replenish. There should be some kind of reward opportunity other than completing a day, especially because you need to play the mini-games to get stars, in order to complete tasks, to complete the day. That’s a lot of tasks to do with not a lot of lives/coin rewards!!! If there were events where you can play other mini-games to gain rewards/treasures I think it would be more efficient. I also think 28 minutes is a long time to wait for one single life. I don’t want to give up on this game with not a lot of time put into it already, but if there is no improvement, I might have to.",I find them to be fun and even addicting.,3,True,enjoyability,positive,4

Including mundane actions like calling someone on the phone or greeting a friend. This wouldn’t be so bad if the puzzles were at least designed more fairly. It seems once you pass a certain level the puzzles of course become get more difficult but they also seem to give the game an unfair advantage over the player. As the levels become more difficult even the boosters seem less effective. Where on prior levels you can get a few boosters and they could help you win the level, but later it takes more than triple the amount of boosters to pass the level and they don’t seem to be as powerful. Some levels are almost not passable without spending actual money to buy enough boosters so you can pass it or unless you just get lucky and pieces fall just right. Even when you do complete a puzzle the amount of coins you win doesn’t seem to match up with the difficulty of that puzzle. Only receiving 60 coins for a puzzle it took 20 times to pass.Making it feel almost not worth all the times you had to play to pass the single puzzle. All of this made me feel like I was being cheated and the game was no longer fun compared to the reward so I decided to stop playing all together after a few weeks of experiencing the same disappointment.",As the levels become more difficult even the boosters seem less effective.,2,True,effectiveness,negative,2

I’d love to be able to store it for future use when I have 3 hours to waste playing games. Also the 900 coins for 5 moves is a little annoying. I’d like to be able to use 100 coins for each move I want to add. I might only use one more move to win and I just wasted 900 coins or it takes me 6 moves but to up the ante a second time costs another 1200 coins. How often do people use the 2100 coins for an extra 10 moves and if they do, did it take them another 5 moves to win or just 1? Let us dish out 100 coins at a time or buy more bombs or something. Love building the house with the wins but start a new day? Really? That’s usually like mid-day or something when it comes up and it might take me 5 days to win the two levels to start a new day. Doesn’t feel value added. And sometimes the tasks are super easy like call someone and it takes 2 games to do it. I’d rather that be one and replace flooring be 5-6.

However, I would really like to see some better incentives to keep players in the game. For some of the side challenges (e.g. knitting), the rewards, such as unlimited lives for a certain period of time, are given immediately. If I had the option to save that reward for a rainy day, perhaps when I’m tackling a particularly difficult level, I’d be more inclined to play for longer periods of time. When this happens, however, it’s almost always the case that I don’t have the time to actually use said reward and it ends up being useless. I’d also like to see the coin rewards have a better balance. 50-70 coins as a reward for each level won? Come on! What about an additional ten or so coins for each remaining turn? Say if I’ve beaten a level and I have five turns left. I should win the base coins of fifty and then an additional fifty for each turn I didn’t use. For harder levels, base coins of 100 and then an additional fifty coins for each additional remaining turn. Now THAT’S an incentive! That would be rad. Otherwise, fun game!","I’ve been playing this game for a while and it’s enjoyable, occasionally challenging, and a good way to kill some time.",4,True,enjoyability,positive,4

But who honestly has time to spend weeks trying beat a single level to continue on with the game. Some levels are literally so difficult that the user ends up frustrated and just closing the game out for the day. Sure I’ve spent a fair amount on money trying to beat those select levels. And I see some user reviews that talk about spending a huge amount of money. But who honestly has time to devote that much energy into a game as well as waste money trying to get through a level just to get stuck and have to spend more money again later on a higher level.

I personally was over the top crazy for it and loved it, but it’s now dead for many reasons. One reason is hackers and cheaters. More mods are being used and hacking and cheating is getting more popular. Some times, I can’t play one game without a hacker or cheater. Multiple people play together and say who is the imposter and some hackers are being able to kill in the middle of meetings and do visuals as imposter. Another reason is that there are no new maps. Among us said that the new airship would come out in early December 2020, but they delayed it and said early 2021. Everyone thought it would come out in January or February, but it’s March and it still hasn’t come out yet. Another reason is that the new chat update can’t let you talk freely. Now you spend all of  your meeting time searching around for the prewritten text that you want to say. Another reason is the horrible connection. Some times, I have to spend like 20 minutes trying to connect my game. People say it’s my bad wifi, but that’s not true because my wifi works perfectly fine.

The game is fun and requires lots of skill or just fast fingers. My only problems are the prices of some of the items. For the characters I think they can get a little bit pricey. When you get a mystery box it can give you items that help you unlock characters. I honestly think that it might take a month or almost a year to reach the amount because I’m not joking, they are really pricey. Unless you playing it nonstop without taking your eyes off the screen then it might take a few weeks. But that’s still a while. Also the hover boards. They can also get a little pricey. And why buy something that you can only use in certain times. It makes it worse that they can get really expensive. Honestly I think their pretty cool but please lower the prices. The last thing you might need to fix is the add lag. Sometimes it will start freezing up and you have to restart the app and that’s a little annoying in my opinion.

Some sounds are still present in the game but some sounds don't play at all such as picking up blocks or when you get hurt or die. Enemies do not make unique sounds when hit and has a seemingly stock sound effect playing. I have not had problem with infinite maps before; however, I now have problems with all maps. The game only feels playable when all high end settings are disabled, mob spawning is disabled, and setting gameplay to peaceful. In addition, the UI is not touch screen friendly like it was in the alpha and beta. I know that I am using old hardware but this many problems for a game that ran otherwise smoothly in the past is ridiculous. One final criticism is that unlike the alpha and beta there are only two rendering options that make the hot bar look pointless: 5 and 6.

The sticky situations are called “Austin’s Bad Dream and in 35 levels, I have only been able to see a few of them.  The game is mostly playing a form of Candy Crush to earn stars in order to improve the home. That part is not so bad. The music is pleasant and the game is a relaxing time waster, at least initially. I don’t mind using the earned stars to replace furniture or a rug, but as the game goes on, you have to use the stars to do just about anything like answering the door, unpacking a TV, or even starting a new day. And once you’re out of stars, you can’t do anything else until you have won more candy crush games and earned more stars. You earn one star from winning each candy crush game no matter how difficult the game is. Win in one round, earn one star. Win after 20 rounds, earn one star. The idea of course is to get the player to purchase items to play longer. I get it.

If you play like 5 games in a row with someone and you’re bonding with them, maybe you have to go or maybe they have to go, or if you get kicked or something, you never get to see each other ever again. Also it could be the same thing except with friends. And maybe you can see if you’re friends (in the game) are playing. 3. Newer stuff, like new colors, tasks and hats would be absolutely amazing!

He would legit kill everyone else and leave me be. So I did the same. But on the other hand, ITS RADIOACTIVE ☢️ X TOXIC X 1,000,000. I’ve seen people being racist, trolls, hackers, cheaters, discord tryhards (people who cheat by letting their friend get killed and their friend tells them who it is), and more. That is absolutely unacceptable. I am not giving up among us, just warning y’all of the murky waters ahead if you get this. Add friend system!!! I want friend system!!! Don’t do so in the next update, and I am telling my friends it’s a bad game, it is sparse in terms of account management (cuz there is no account managements or accounts at all) it has a toxic community, and can have bad connections sometimes. Edit: well, thanks for adding anonymous options! It will help a lot in games. I also appreciate you adding symbols to the wires for those colorblind people. Still, add a friend system. I really want to add my friends. You need to fix this. I meet new and kind people. Develop friendship.

First was ads that would play after clicking on the home icon. I don’t mind ads that I choose to watch because I want to double my reward, but I don’t want to see ads when moving from one screen to the next. The most recent major annoyance is the red exclamation point on the Shop button. After I click the daily reward and the offers, the red exclamation point still remains. What the heck?!? I don’t want to keep seeing it. Yes, I know there are special offers, and the daily reward is ready, but what else? The third annoyance is ads within ads. What is this new type of purgatory? I see a screen playing a different ad within the ad that’s playing. And the last annoyance (for now, anyway) is that the sound is not always off even when the phone is on silent. What if I were in an important board meeting and surreptitiously playing Subway Surfers and the sound for the ad bursts out? If I silence the game, I expect the ads to be silenced as well. I’ll rate Subway Surfers as 5 ⭐️ if the ad issues are solved, because the game play and reward system is great.",Recent changes have really annoyed me.,4,True,general,negative,5

It sounds crazy, but I almost wish it was back to the days when you lived off of cows and used boats, but now it’s all cheats and crazy builds and bees. But my favorite part has to be the soundtrack. Listening to these songs, all the memories flow in and rush back, and I think about my brother and cousin building a mansion, and me begging to play, or when my brother would still play with me. This game was my childhood. And while everyone else is crooning over Fortnite, Minecraft remains the best. The music is just magnificent. But, there are a few things that need fixing. Whenever I get on, it says there was an account error, and I don’t even have an account. Also, I made a few characters and they fail to load. Finally, I just wish on Pocket Edition you could go back to different updates so I could play like I used to; no bees, no dolphins, no crazy stuff - just how the game started out.

However, the game is hard to play on my own time. The game really only works when it wants to. Some are do to bugs, and some are due to just poor design. 1) Game will not load when you go offline still logged into Xbox. It will not let you sign out, and the game crashes repeatedly. I have not found a way to fix this, because even when I try to enable cellular data, it still will not load because no changes in settings are saved before the game crashes. This is extremely inconvenient when I just want to play single player offline. This bug has been going on for months and is consistently overlooked. Please fix this immediately. It discourages players from even attempting to load up their worlds, which ultimately hurts the developers.2) Background music stops when Minecraft is launched. If you are listening to Spotify/Pandora, etc, then the game automatically cuts off your music when you listen to the game. If people didn’t pause their music before entering the game, then obviously, they want to listen to it while the play! This was definitely programmed in, for reasons I can’t even begin to comprehend.

However, I do have a few critiques. I think the developers should add some unlock able content that you don’t have to pay extra for. I feel it would give more incentive for people to play the game. On another note it would be beneficial to add a friends list feature so you can play with others you meet online as well as people you know in person. Also I’m not a fan of the chat situation. I feel like an open chat forum would allow for more dexterity in the game. Instead you can only choose from pre-selected text which I find annoying at times because in real life it’s easier to make negotiations with others if you can say exactly what you what/mean.

The graphics, gameplay, and everything overall is amazing! I was also thinking of some things that could be added. This is something I heard on the internet and isn’t original, but I wanted to spread it around because it sounds interesting. What if there was a role called “Jester” where their goal is to get ejected, making them win? Sounds like it could be a hit or miss, but I think that’d be cool. Also a role of “Detective” sounds interesting. Like, you can give that person the option to take screenshots, so they can have solid alibis/evidence of the imposter, but only they have it, so that the crew mates don’t have too much of an advantage. They can send the screenshots to the chat, helping out their case (maybe also a limited amount of screenshots so their not overpowered?). Also the idea of adding friends would be cool! It’s sad you can’t add anyone, and the strangers you could enjoy playing with you’ll only play with once. It would also be nice to adopt mini crew mates whenever their parent dies, I just think that would be very wholesome. More colors would also be cool, I mean, this is only optional since the colors that are already there are great, but I think it’s something to keep in mind. But overall, fantastic game!

This is obviously built on that annoying subscription model for premium services. And it’s not free in the first place. No, I don’t want to pay extra for a new board or player piece...it’s just software. Give me a break.Second, there are some pretty bad playability issues. One is initiating trades; the user interface makes it impossible to pick multiple things on the left half of the screen because the player boxes cover the properties. Another is that tapping anywhere near the bottom right when trying to select one of your own properties causes the game to think you tapped the “end turn” button, screwing up your turn. Another horrible gameplay thing is the fact that AI players constantly choose “auction” instead of buying properties outright, which is not at all like how people in real life play the game. Not only that, but the AI player that initiated the auction will bid all the way up to the original cost of the property...why on earth would anyone ever do that? Sloppy gameplay for sure.The older Monopoly game on the App Store, which I purchased long ago, was quite a bit better. This is obviously aimed at milking people for buying new playing boards and player pieces. Pretty gross cash grab.

I have a few suggestions for things you could add or fix. My first thing and biggest thing is a friends list because sometimes when your playing you meet this awesome person but then one of you have to go and you will never see that person that you bonded with again. Another thing is new colors, hats, and pets. I think there should be a wider variety of colors including gray, dark red, light purple, and a tie color could be awesome! There should be additional hats added as well like a set of head phones, glasses, new wigs, and a set of pretty wings. I also think that there should be more pets and pets that you don’t have to pay for or like watch a certain amount of adds to unlock this pet or do this to unlock this pet. I think they should add a poddle pet, cat, and a bird would be cool. Something that kinda bothers me is that Mirah HQ (probably spelled wrong) doesn’t have cameras in it. I have also encountered some people who have asked sexual questions and wanted to do sexual activity I know that you can’t really do anything about that but I wanted to put that out there.

There should be a way to kick people faster if you’re the host during a game.

As the boards get harder we should get more stars, Hard=2 stars, Super Hard=3 stars and so forth, as we advance in the game tasks cost more stars so we should naturally EARN more stars to off set it!  Not keep us at 1 star per level, but the higher we go tasks are costing us 6-12 stars PER TASK, come on!! Same with the coins! It’s not fair, and you are forcing people to spend money if they want to continue in the game at a reasonable pace. Love the game, hate the setup! Not spending money on this, they need to change the system!",It makes it extremely hard and tedious to advance in the game.,2,True,general,negative,5

I do not notice the same when moving right. The pogo sticks need some reworking. I can rarely see which lane the prize is in at the end of the jump. Finally, some of the challenges have not been working. I had one with no rolls or jumps in a certain number of points that would not increment or ever reach success criteria no matter how long I went. Then suddenly would declare success out of the blue.

First was ads that would play after clicking on the home icon. I don’t mind ads that I choose to watch because I want to double my reward, but I don’t want to see ads when moving from one screen to the next. The most recent major annoyance is the red exclamation point on the Shop button. After I click the daily reward and the offers, the red exclamation point still remains. What the heck?!? I don’t want to keep seeing it. Yes, I know there are special offers, and the daily reward is ready, but what else? The third annoyance is ads within ads. What is this new type of purgatory? I see a screen playing a different ad within the ad that’s playing. And the last annoyance (for now, anyway) is that the sound is not always off even when the phone is on silent. What if I were in an important board meeting and surreptitiously playing Subway Surfers and the sound for the ad bursts out? If I silence the game, I expect the ads to be silenced as well. I’ll rate Subway Surfers as 5 ⭐️ if the ad issues are solved, because the game play and reward system is great.",The most recent major annoyance is the red exclamation point on the Shop button.,4,True,aesthetics,negative,0

It’s my “go to” favorite.  I’m somewhere around level 1100 or close to it.  Some levels are hard to the point that it gets ridiculous.  Some of the hard levels are easy or perhaps it’s just luck to win them.  I have spent days on a level and get frustrated and then dont play for a while...but i still really enjoy this game.  You CAN win every level with out a power up.  You DO NOT need to spend any money on this game, patience is a virtue (so they say).  I have spent money and lately I haven’t.  The one thing i do agree with most reviewers on is this... to buy a power up costs wayyy too much money for the amount of coins you receive for passing a level.  To continue a game (at 900 coins) for a move or two costs a fortune considering you really don’t win much.  To buy three hammers costs too much (1900 coins).  I realize they do want you to spend money and i have but even when you spend, it doesn’t give you much in return.  I mostly just wanted to let people know you don’t have to spend money to win this game...and yes, some of the tasks are eye rolling but....its still a fun game.

If you don’t have, let’s say, about 400,000 coins and that’s how much a character you really want your not going to be able to get it because it’s so expensive. You can’t earn that much in a month.

I personally was over the top crazy for it and loved it, but it’s now dead for many reasons. One reason is hackers and cheaters. More mods are being used and hacking and cheating is getting more popular. Some times, I can’t play one game without a hacker or cheater. Multiple people play together and say who is the imposter and some hackers are being able to kill in the middle of meetings and do visuals as imposter. Another reason is that there are no new maps. Among us said that the new airship would come out in early December 2020, but they delayed it and said early 2021. Everyone thought it would come out in January or February, but it’s March and it still hasn’t come out yet. Another reason is that the new chat update can’t let you talk freely. Now you spend all of  your meeting time searching around for the prewritten text that you want to say. Another reason is the horrible connection. Some times, I have to spend like 20 minutes trying to connect my game. People say it’s my bad wifi, but that’s not true because my wifi works perfectly fine. The last reason is that some people change settings so that either the crew or the imposters have an almost certain win. If you are reading this long review, then I thank you for your time. If you are reading this and are from inner sloth, then hopefully you will consider doing something to revive among us.","Among us said that the new airship would come out in early December 2020, but they delayed it and said early 2021.",2,True,general,negative,5

There also needs to be a friends list where you can add someone if you like them, because as of now you just lose that person forever. There also needs to be (this is the feature I want the most) to be a statistics option where you can see how many wins and losses, minutes played etc. and lastly, there should be a clock on the top of the screen, because when you exit this app, maybe to check the time, it disconnects you from the game entirely. Other than that, it’s good to go, but even then it’s still very sad, knowing these things are missing.

It is so addicting and I love playing it with my friends. I would 100% recommend this game. I would give it 5 stars, however there are three things I would love to see added. The first one is a friends system because it would be a lot easier to join a friend’s game if you could just click ‘join game’ like in roblox. A second thing I would love to see added is a currency like coins or maybe something more creative like aliens. Then, players should receive say, 5 aliens or coins if they win as a crew mate and 10 aliens or coins if they win as imposter. Then, I think players should be able to use these coins/aliens to buy hats or outfits. I also think it would be really cool if we could use this currency to buy higher imposter chances because I would love if I could do that. The third and final thing I would love to see added is a report button. This would be good because I have noticed that some people say weird or disturbing things in my games quite often. I know the creators can’t control what people say, but it would be nice if they could be reported for it. Overall, I love among us but I would love to see these three things added. P.S.

I can fairly say that it is a well-executed game with consistent updates and support. I like the creative side as well as the puzzle side it’s a nice balance. One thing everyone should know unequivocally before beginning, however, is that the developers hate the players. Hate may not even be a strong enough word for it. I could be wrong, maybe it’s impossible to fairly balance a puzzle game but to program it so much in the favor of you losing is... unsurprising considering how often it wants you to purchase things. Now, you don’t have ads in this game, which is nice, and the options to purchase don’t ensure victory (I mean at all), so in a sense the game is consistent and there’s some comfort in that. The reward system is pretty rough, it does sometimes feel like an endless attempt to wear you down. You will rage quit from time to time, or put it down for a couple months, but this is a casual game. Whereas other games make me feel as if they’ve earned my business, I find the challenge of this one is seeing how far I can go without spending any money, because it tries so hard.

They're pop-up, not videos, so they don't disrupt your game. However, like all games, this one has some problems. My biggest issue is the top run. Every week, the contestants get harder to beat, and eventually you can't get past the last person in the silver because they have over a million. Also, if you get a really good medal, like the diamond, you don't get to keep it for the next week because it changes depending on where you are that week. Another problem is the keys. To revive yourself, you have to pay more and more each time, until it gets so expensive that you can't even afford it. The only way to get keys is in the run, in mystery boxes, or in awards, which is a huge problem because: you only find a key in a run about every eighteen games or so, and if you miss it, then you don't have a chance to get another one. It is extremely rare to get a key in a mystery box, and when you do, it's only one, which can't even begin to pay for the expenses of reviving yourself.

I thought I was making the mistakes but nope every game it happens SEVERAL times. Roll a five & it will go 6 to land you on someone’s hotel...incredibly frustrating.  The game is also very predictable. If you build properties the next roll the next player almost every time won't land on you. I like the game, however another issue is that it freezes up at crucial junctures of the game. Such as after a trade. You have no choice after several minutes to abandon the game. Very frustrating after vesting so much time into it. Also I just finished a game & I bankrupted every player then it announced the last bankrupted player as the “winner!”. Ticks you off especially after spending an hour with idiots that want to make the same trade every single turn! I almost quit several times but I hung in there and put up with it because the other normal player suffering through the BS like I was. The game definitely needs some improvements.

Idk why they had to change the engine they were on but it made the game buggy and unresponsive at times. Before this update, I could honestly say the game was perfect. I had 0 issues. The hoverboard mechanic was very responsive even at the higher speed late game. The physics were doing great for a game, but now the hoverboard lags at times, I was in a super late game run where I attempted to activate the hoverboard and it didn’t work until my 4th attempt at double tapping. This wouldn’t have been an issue in the previous update. Also, the roofs can end your game even with a hoverboard? I have the monster board with the high jump ability and I made it admittedly higher than expected, but I just expected to lose the board and continue, but no it killed me entirely. The previous update where I did the same just passed me through no worries. If this is for added difficulty, I guess I can understand, but the fluidity the game once had is gone. The graphics are also poorer in my opinion as well. Also, whose idea was it to change cap of the multiplier from 30 to 29.

However I did find more cons than pros. Let’s start off with finding a server. You have three different maps to choose from. You can also choose if you want to play with 1, 2, or 3 imposters. The imposter’s job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with “Confirm Ejects” and “Visual Tasks” on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says “(insert anything here) was not An Imposter” or “was An Imposter”. With it being the imposter’s job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! This game is ruled by immature 12 year olds and when they get accused, they break lose. I am not exaggerating, I have heard the N word, the F word, and so many other ridiculously bad and racist words in this game than I did in the real world. The N word is a word that you will encounter. People think it’s okay if they leave the hard r out but it’s not. The N word is probably the most popular word in this game.

No big deal, it’s something that can happen sometimes and I can just join right back in. But after 5 minutes it did it again. Then again. And again. Keep in mind I was sitting right next to my router and had all my bars and yet the game kept booting me from the server. I bounced the internet twice and still came out with the same results. Sometimes I would close the entire game and reopen it only to find that the world wouldn’t even pop up. We were stuck in this complicated dance for over an hour before we decided to call it quits out of utter frustration. There is no way this could just be my internet. Not only was I mere inches away from the router but I was the only one in my house. Nobody else was connected to the internet but me so why did I keep getting booted out of the server?

This time the app completely crashes every time it loads. It sends me right back to my home screen. Seriously. Someone help me out here. These sort of bugs have happened multiple times.

Coins are sold in the shop for .99 cents per 900 which is crazy expensive considering 900 coins will on get 5 additional moves or 3 destroy balls (not sure what they are actually called). If 5 mores moves is not enough to complete the level the next 5 cost 1200 coins. The puzzles are designed to require boosts or additional moves. Each puzzle won rewards a star. Stars are required to perform actions for upgrading the garden or home. Though it is satisfying to watch the transformations and improvements I get frustrated when required to spend a star to greet someone at the door to receive a package, then another star to open the package. All the extra actions not related to actual upgrades seems like a complete waste of stars considering the difficulty of obtaining them.

When you join “Online Multiplayer”, and you’re playing, you can leave the app and come back however long later, and the game would continue from where you left off. This is the first evidence of AI in an online supposed real person mode. The second bit of evidence is that the AI trades at very specific rates: when you’re paying cash for a property, they want double the property price. If you offer too much lower than double, they’ll permanently reject the offer. Closer to double, and they’ll counter for double. Third bit of evidence is when they offer you a trade, and you decline. If they offered money, they’ll make another offer increasing their offer by 10$. Decline again, they’ll increase by 10$ again. And so on. Another issue is that on Multiplayer with friends, if you accidentally leave the app, you’re instantly replaced with an AI and there’s no way for you to rejoin. This makes your phone unusable other than to play the game if you don’t want to erase all the progress you’ve just made on a match with a friend. Please look into this.

It discourages players from even attempting to load up their worlds, which ultimately hurts the developers.2) Background music stops when Minecraft is launched. If you are listening to Spotify/Pandora, etc, then the game automatically cuts off your music when you listen to the game. If people didn’t pause their music before entering the game, then obviously, they want to listen to it while the play! This was definitely programmed in, for reasons I can’t even begin to comprehend. Please remove this feature, as it is just annoying, especially when constantly trying to reload your game due to the bug mentioned above.",This is extremely inconvenient when I just want to play single player offline.,3,True,learnability,negative,6

That is no reason to give it one star and if you actually give the app a chance I think anybody would like it I think if the only bad comments are the app keeps crashing or the Same stinking thing then that could just be a not updated device so my advice to anybody don’t knock it till you try it.

I LOVE this game, considering how hard it is to find a murder mystery game that is fun, challenging, and overall a enjoyable game. And I gotta say, this game nails the classic murder mystery game vibe. Considering how easy it is to pick up and go, you can really play it whenever you want, which is awesome in on itself, but it only makes it even better is how it’s free on mobile, is so nice, and it’s one of the main reasons it got popular in the first place, almost anyone with a phone could get the game! Sure, the advertisements can be a bit annoying, but that is really a small hiccup in the game, and besides, a free game has to have some kind of advertisements to keep it alive, so it’s hardly even a problem. The only real issue I had with this game was connection issues, but again, the game overall kinda shadows out the issues. The tasks/mini games are probably one of the best parts about this game, each one feels fun to do, especially if you can get a rhythm for each task. And the fact that you can have small meetings to decide who they think the murderer/imposter is, is GENIUS. This makes the game run at a good pace, makes replay ability amazing, and overall a amazing game. So innersloth, I’m excited for the updates and ideas you have for this game in the future! Amazing work!","The only real issue I had with this game was connection issues, but again, the game overall kinda shadows out the issues.",5,True,effectiveness,negative,2

It’s fun, entertaining, and creative. But the LAG. Recently, a few days ago, when playing with my friend in a world, it kept kicking me out of the app, disconnecting me, yet I have full bars of internet. One time, when I was sleeping, it kicked me out. When I went back into the world, it kept me in the sleeping mode. However, whenever I put leave bed, it would kick me out of the app. Some side effects were my avatar got glitchy and laggy. I don’t know if it’s my device or not, but I cannot talk about it. Secondly, I would like if we can build all the materials except the blocks, (nether blocks, etc.). I hate that every time I see a horse, I have to change cheats on and change to creative to get a saddle.I would also like if we could make realistic things like tables, plates to put in our food in, chairs, etc. Although minor, it would still be a great update if it was actual c: Edit: I just dropped it down to 1 star, maybe even deserves zero for how much I disconnect and lag. It’s frustrating having to get kicked out, join back in, and it not being saved. I get kicked out every 5-10 min. Each time I turn off my wifi.

I thought I was making the mistakes but nope every game it happens SEVERAL times. Roll a five & it will go 6 to land you on someone’s hotel...incredibly frustrating.  The game is also very predictable. If you build properties the next roll the next player almost every time won't land on you. I like the game, however another issue is that it freezes up at crucial junctures of the game. Such as after a trade. You have no choice after several minutes to abandon the game. Very frustrating after vesting so much time into it. Also I just finished a game & I bankrupted every player then it announced the last bankrupted player as the “winner!”. Ticks you off especially after spending an hour with idiots that want to make the same trade every single turn! I almost quit several times but I hung in there and put up with it because the other normal player suffering through the BS like I was. The game definitely needs some improvements.

Now all the ads I see for this game don't make sense. I see some where the main characters are trapped on an island and they are being attacked by a shark, some where they are stranded in the cold and freezing, and within the last couple days I saw two more that DONT MAKE SENSE! The guy has to pee and he’s running down the hall and things are breaking. Then the reason I wrote this review is because I was so confused and disturbed by the one I just saw: the guy has his hands and feet tied to bed posts and the room is on fire and he wants to escape.

But.....,"So this is a great game! and if your not playing it, what are you doing go ahead and download!

For example some people who are on your team as imposter will see you kill someone and then report the body and say (your name/ color) DID IT! And it’s really annoying. Another thing is sometimes bodies that are next to a door that’s closed, you can’t see the body not that big of a deal but I’ve gotten voted of bc of it one time, idk if this was a glitch but I think the guy was modding or something but I was in admin on the skeld and the report button popped up but there wasn’t a body another guy was in there as well and even said there wasn’t a body on his screen either idk if it was a bug or a modder but I got voted off for it and it frustrated me quite a bit other bugs as well but there not really a big deal because there only there for a min or 2 and the game still operates as it should... plus teaming is a big issue but there’s not really anything you can do about that.other than these things amazing game definitely recommend.

It has changed so much and suddenly blew up out of know where! I have been creating boat racing maps, and almost everything I can imagine. If you can imagine it build it, not only does it show how creative you can be but also make you get more ideas, it’s almost an addictive cycle. Weird I know I took a break from this game for a year and then boom out of no where blew up.  I would always love to think back to 2011 to when I enjoyed this game on an old pc at my grandparents. Now I can’t stop playing it. All I can say is thank you, bringing us entertainment for all these years. This game has been there sense the start and came out rough into the best sandbox game I have ever played. Sure there are some negatives about the game, like you can’t get custom skins off files on Xbox without having to decrepit the games files. I always had used MCPE skin creator/editor and it worked amazingly but sad to know I can only do it on mobile. But put that aside, and you have an overall 90/10 game right now for me it’s perfect as it is. Sadly the original creators of Minecraft are gone and now bough by another company, if your reading this you might say, the new company is bad. But what they did to the game is so amazing, doing more than the original game designers would to with it.

Although, I see a lot of negative feedback, I 100% disagree. To explain the complaints about how hard it is to beat people who are in gold/diamond, they have worked hard to get to where they are. So, yes it may be a little challenging to beat them but that’s not the games fault. I believe this game is one of the best games out there. Especially because the game is culture friendly. This game has characters from all over the world, and even characters that are make believe or just not real. I have been playing this game since i was little, my grandmother introduced me to the game and I got pretty addicted. But, in my opinion that just goes to show this game is for ALL ages and everyone can enjoy it. So again please don’t blame the game for those that have worked hard to permanently earn a spot in gold/diamond. If you made it to the end of my LONG review, thanks for reading my report.

I first saw it played on Twitch and said I have got to experience this. The graphics, animation and modeling are really fun. Based on old reviews, I think many issues from the past are solved. The network seems reliable and the rules and variations are pretty much on point. The AI players add a new dimension. They are annoying at worst and a wonderful addition for shrewd dealing humans, at best. The klunky repetitious and nonsensical “offers” they make are pretty bad. And the fact that they only assess deals based on value of the deeds and classifying them as “easy, medium, or hard” just improves their luck and reduces yours makes them pretty frustrating at times. But they’re fun to push around and like I said, they create a whole new dimension in game play. Imagine making a deal with a predictable robot to mess up your human opponent, etc. That said, the overall game feels cold and lonely. How do we know we are really playing against a human when we join Multiplayer online? What is our own record of wins and losses? What if we want to play against a particular player again?

You start playing and realize how addicting it is!! You play nonstop for hours. *2 months later* You haven’t played in a bit, so you open up the app and start playing. You instantly get bored. The problem with this game is that you do the same thing over and over again, different setting or not. It gets very boring. #2: You can’t get all the characters.

It has usual free play features like picking tasks and being the impostor. But with one major difference: the AI is more intelligent. I’ll give you a look at both sides of this mode. CREWMATE VIEW:You run around doing tasks with the other AI crew mates. And one of the crew mates is the impostor. The impostor’s AI does intelligent stuff like: trapping you in rooms, sabotaging electricity and such, and so much more! IMPOSTOR VIEW:The crew mates are doing tasks. While your the impostor. You take down the AI crew mates and such. But the AI crew mates does intelligent things like the AI impostor. Like:Reporting dead bodies, calling emergency meetings, and so much more! I would love to see all of this added into free play mode. I will be awaiting your response.EDIT:Ok, I think a great feature to have would be when the impostor kills you and your pet cries, you can comfort it. Like pet it and tell it everything is gonna be okay. Then it’s happy and it starts following your ghost. I would love this feature. Once again, I will be awaiting your response.—Your biggest fan",I would love this feature.,5,True,general,positive,5

The first one is a friends system because it would be a lot easier to join a friend’s game if you could just click ‘join game’ like in roblox. A second thing I would love to see added is a currency like coins or maybe something more creative like aliens. Then, players should receive say, 5 aliens or coins if they win as a crew mate and 10 aliens or coins if they win as imposter. Then, I think players should be able to use these coins/aliens to buy hats or outfits. I also think it would be really cool if we could use this currency to buy higher imposter chances because I would love if I could do that. The third and final thing I would love to see added is a report button. This would be good because I have noticed that some people say weird or disturbing things in my games quite often. I know the creators can’t control what people say, but it would be nice if they could be reported for it. Overall, I love among us but I would love to see these three things added. P.S.

It’s so fun and the strategy involved makes it more exciting to play. It also gives such a rush of adrenaline. But whilst this game is structured beautifully and an incredible game, I do have a few small tips that I think could make this game better than it already is. First of all, an add friend button. Me and my friends love playing servers together and being able to friend other users could make it easier to game together. Also a microphone feature would be great. Chatting with the other users whilst playing out loud could be really great, because you’d be talking instead of typing through a screen. You’d be able to pick a game with microphone chatting or without, just whatever you prefer personally. Also being to branch out into private chats with people in the server would be really good. That way you could discuss plans with fellow imposters and win in a better and more strategized way. Also you could chat with friends you’re playing with separately. It would add a better feature of strategy and even betrayal to the game. You could even use it for persuasion purposes. Those are a few small but very effective features I think us among us users would love and highly appreciate!

This game, it’s pretty decent. I’ll give it its credit. It’s a well made game and well marketed. Here’s the deal. Minecraft has been a game for years and still has multiple unfixed big bugs. It’s not crazy that such a game on a mobile device gets such bugs. When it gets to the point of me having to delete and reinstall the app over and over, it starts to get on your nerves. I’m thirteen btw. I’m just trying to play with my little sister. I spend hours upon hours building her her perfect dream mansion only to one day try to open the app and it crash. This time the app completely crashes every time it loads. It sends me right back to my home screen. Seriously. Someone help me out here. These sort of bugs have happened multiple times. I’ve notified mojang and they just told me to delete and reinstall the app. They SHOULDN’T have to tell me to DELETE the app. All the hard work 😂😓. Anyway, thank you for reading my comment.

I find them to be fun and even addicting. Although the concept of the game is great, and I’ve only been playing for a short while, something needs to be improved with the coin/lives system. Getting around 50 coins per mini-game, which can take multiple lives to complete, isn’t sufficient enough. In order to buy a life, 900 coins, you would have to play around 18 rounds just to get enough coins for ONE life. I do not pay money on games, never have never will, but it’s so frustrating that you may have one move left and instead of paying real cash, not in game coins, you have to wait for a life to replenish just to try and fail at the level again. Each round can take 10+ lives to complete, and it takes quite awhile for the lives to replenish. There should be some kind of reward opportunity other than completing a day, especially because you need to play the mini-games to get stars, in order to complete tasks, to complete the day. That’s a lot of tasks to do with not a lot of lives/coin rewards!!! If there were events where you can play other mini-games to gain rewards/treasures I think it would be more efficient. I also think 28 minutes is a long time to wait for one single life. I don’t want to give up on this game with not a lot of time put into it already, but if there is no improvement, I might have to.","I have played many, and I mean MANY, games such as this one in my lifetime.",3,True,enjoyability,positive,4

His parents, as empty-nesters, have decided to sell their large estate and move into a smaller, more efficient home - better suited for their needs and season of life. Well Austin, being obviously wiser than they, immediately moves back into his parent’s house and convinces his aging parents to not only stay living in an enormous mansion they can’t possibly keep up with, but to spare no expense at fixing the monolith up. If that part of the story doesn’t fry your bacon, then be prepared for pointless  tasks designed to eat up the stars you earn on activities NOT RELATED to repairing the old mansion and the rooms within. The levels require very little strategy; I find the board layout to be purely based on luck and it can take several days or even weeks to beat one, so earning stars to get ahead will truly enslave you to this game. As for the characters; Austin is the know-it-all son, his father a dim-witted buffoon, and his mother has no personality. His relationship with Katherine is uninteresting and ALL other characters are one-dimensional stereotypes. So if any or all of those things appeal to you, download the game.

It will be someone else’s turn and they just never come out of their turn. I think their should be a time limit once they have handled they business. Otherwise you have to wait until they “end turn” & this creates problems in the game. My games were all lost and needed to be exited after this occurred and all that I worked for or played for was lost. This creates a waste of time. Which is pretty unfortunate but other than that this game is extremely fun. I purchased both the other boards the snow and the 1930’s board I love all of them. Wish the tokens were a bit cheaper and more options. Overall few bug fixes and this game is going to remain my favorite. I have been telling everyone about it so that they can join me in a game virtually!,Which is pretty unfortunate but other than that this game is extremely fun.,4,True,enjoyability,positive,4

There is so much glitches present in Among Us. The last round I played the impostor was the only one remaining but the round was continuing. The black screen glitch is extremely common and sometimes the lobby glitches into the map and the game is unplayable. Second reason: The game barely updates. Ever since I started playing the game, the biggest update (not including bug fixes) was the chat assist and that is about the only new thing I can name. For a half of a year, practically nothing was added. If you cannot maintain the game properly, then you should sell it to a company that can. Third is the community. Although the developers cannot control this, it still makes the game a bad experience for many players. You may have added what I am about to say already, but if you didn’t, you should add a age restriction. There are a lot of people that play Among Us who are not very smart and accuse people for no reason and everybody listens without any evidence. This makes the game very easy for the impostor because of how gullible the majority of the community is. And even if you are the impostor it still ruins the game because you can execute it perfectly and still get voted out because “Red sus” I have stopped playing the game because it just never added anything new and became very bland. And the community adds on to the bad experience.",Second reason: The game barely updates.,3,True,general,negative,5

Thank you for not trying to fix or improve something that isn’t broken! However I do have one concern. During the game I had an opponent land on a chance and received the “Advance token to Boardwalk” card. Another person rolled and also landed on chance. Then I landed on chance and received the same card as the first guy “Advance token to Boardwalk”. Now when I was a young boy I was told you’re supposed to put your card in another pile and shuffle them when they are all used up. Or you can keep them in rotation and place the card at the bottom. You guys need to fix this. Also I recommend creating more free tokens the options are extremely minimal. Other than that the game is excellent, no glitches, no freezing up. They also have online multiplayer! Thank you!","Other than that the game is excellent, no glitches, no freezing up.",5,True,enjoyability,positive,4

But, I would like to request a feature. Could there be an option to have more intelligent crew mates/impostors in free play? For example: I start up free play and see an option saying “would you like to turn on intelligent mode?” I turn it on and free play starts. It has usual free play features like picking tasks and being the impostor. But with one major difference: the AI is more intelligent. I’ll give you a look at both sides of this mode. CREWMATE VIEW:You run around doing tasks with the other AI crew mates. And one of the crew mates is the impostor. The impostor’s AI does intelligent stuff like: trapping you in rooms, sabotaging electricity and such, and so much more! IMPOSTOR VIEW:The crew mates are doing tasks. While your the impostor. You take down the AI crew mates and such. But the AI crew mates does intelligent things like the AI impostor. Like:Reporting dead bodies, calling emergency meetings, and so much more! I would love to see all of this added into free play mode. I will be awaiting your response.EDIT:Ok, I think a great feature to have would be when the impostor kills you and your pet cries, you can comfort it.

There are 2 that really stick out. The first one starts once you get to about 100k score, but gets more prevalent once you get to about 250k. What it happens is, when you jump from the ramp up onto the train, and land on the train, you stay floating, and it won’t let you jump or roll, once you go to the left or right, it’s fixed though. That doesn’t mean it’s fine though, because if you don’t notice it, it might kill you. The second, and worse of the two comes down to the hit-boxes. This just happened to me right before writing this review. On top of the trains, sometimes you just want to go left or right, but when you try, you stumble into nothing. That just happened to me... two trains in a row and it got me killed. Luckily I had just started the round and it seems to happen in the early stages most often so at least it’s hard to ruin your high score with that glitch, but that one is much more annoying because you can’t avoid it. There are a few others that aren’t as bad, for example, earlier I had super sneakers on and went into a jet pack, paused the game for a bit, then I started running in the air with the jet pack on. I also have screen recordings of the first glitch and this one.

If you decide to just stick with private mode then you will be absolutely fine. You can have a fun time with some friends and overall enjoy this game. But then I tried public games.It wasn’t as bad as you think it would be. I ran into a total of one weirdo and was totally fine. I had no problems. The only time something really weird happened was when somebody with a weird name had tried to get us to follow his/her Twitter, but thanks to the new update Among Us blocks your ability to redirect to another website in the chat. Here’s the thing though. Recently, I ran into another one of the weird-named people, and they said in the chat that the lobby was hacked and he/she had all of the players’ IP addresses. This was an empty threat, as IP addresses are public knowledge (and you can’t find out where you are based on them)and Apple phones are virtually impossible to hack. However, this really shook me up and I deleted Among Us immediately. I didn’t want to be hacked. EVER. It was kind of scary even though I knew the extensive anti-hacking measures taken place by InnerSloth (the game’s creator). While this game is fun, it’s not worth it being scared every time my friends aren’t up for a game. If you are getting this for a group of friends/family, then you are fine.

However, I bought this app so that I could play with my long distant friends, but we could never finish ANY game. The game has way too many bugs. It crashes and stop the game every time someone disconnect, which affects you and everyone else playing the same match. Getting disconnected is way too common, it happens when you get notification, when you click off the game for a split second, when you get a call, when you get a low battery warning, or poor wifi connection. The game can stop and crash at any point in the game. I wasted 2 hours playing a round just so it could crash mostly every single time. Out of the 35 games I’ve played, I only got through 7 of them. Mind you, I had to pay for this app. It’s ridiculous. DONT BUY THIS APP unless they start making changes and improvements to it. Also they do not have any type of communication system so you can’t talk to your opponents. That should be included in the game to communicate with your opponents, negotiate for trades, or just to simply remind your opponents to end the game. There are many more flaws that takes away the authentic feeling of playing the boardgame Monopoly.

Seriously, the game used to be good enough to be played by all ages, but now it seems like only 6 year olds can enjoy the design. Another thing, this may have been a glitch or something, but where did my coins go? I had like 700,000+ coins, but after the update I was down to about 100,000. Not cool. Not cool at all.

But you reach a certain point where you have to have boosters to beat the levels, & because Playtrix only gives you a max of 70 coins for each level beat (a taudry amount considering what things cost in the game), you end up spending  your own money  to be able to keep playing levels, or to be able to buy boosters to beat the levels. To break it down for you: I’m at level 122 (which is impossible to beat without a booster because of how it is set up), which is about midway through the 5th decoration level in the game (haven’t even broached the upstairs level yet). I’ve already spent $60 on coins/boosters, & I’ve only been playing 2 weeks. Not going to spend anymore $ on this (even though I enjoy it) simply on principle. The rewards for levels are not anywhere close to what they should be, & the amounts you get for what you pay for aren’t enough either. In other games if you spent $20 you would be set for a couple weeks. This game ends up being a days at most because of demand for boosters/coins to the cost ratio. I see this company fizzling out soon because of this. It’s a shame. They have a good game.

However, the game is hard to play on my own time. The game really only works when it wants to. Some are do to bugs, and some are due to just poor design. 1) Game will not load when you go offline still logged into Xbox. It will not let you sign out, and the game crashes repeatedly. I have not found a way to fix this, because even when I try to enable cellular data, it still will not load because no changes in settings are saved before the game crashes. This is extremely inconvenient when I just want to play single player offline. This bug has been going on for months and is consistently overlooked. Please fix this immediately. It discourages players from even attempting to load up their worlds, which ultimately hurts the developers.2) Background music stops when Minecraft is launched. If you are listening to Spotify/Pandora, etc, then the game automatically cuts off your music when you listen to the game. If people didn’t pause their music before entering the game, then obviously, they want to listen to it while the play! This was definitely programmed in, for reasons I can’t even begin to comprehend.

To continue a game (at 900 coins) for a move or two costs a fortune considering you really don’t win much.  To buy three hammers costs too much (1900 coins).

Fight off mobs with weapons, or build a horn your own creative way. Make farms for food, enchant your weapons, and explore villages. There is so much more to do! I’ve played this since I was 4 years old and I still do! It’s AWESOME! If people hate on Minecraft, then I’m very disappointed in them. Minecraft is a one of a kind game with so much potential that it has already given us. More cool ideas can always be added. It has an awesome community, lots of servers and cool mods, and even has cool stuff like Minecon for you to look forward to. Because of COVID19, this year’s Minecon might be cancelled. I really hope not. Anyways, that is off topic to this review. I have so many good experiences playing Minecraft. I can remember worlds that me and my cousins would play in. We would build hotels and make our own parkour courses. We tested out with redefine and command blocks, too. Seriously, games like Fortnite have NOTHING against Minecraft! I’m always gonna be a Minecraft fan. I can’t wait for the new nether update coming! It’s advanced the nether A LOT! It’s just awesome! Plus, Minecraft puts out 2 big awesome updates a year. Seriously, I HIGHLY recommend Minecraft. Not scary, not boring, it’s VERY fun, even if your not a gamer, there is a 99.9% chance you are going to love it!

And if you’re under 13 or whatever age it is, it won’t even let you chose your own name! What’s up with that? However it did have the new map. But with the new update I can only use the quick chat thingy which stinks. Anyway, I tried joining a game and when the game was about to tell if I’m crewmate or imposter or whatever the screen goes black and nothing happens. So I close out of the app and delete the app. When I re-downloaded it it didn’t let me chose my age again, so I was stuck with the non-custom name and the quick chat.

This game was my childhood. And while everyone else is crooning over Fortnite, Minecraft remains the best. The music is just magnificent. But, there are a few things that need fixing. Whenever I get on, it says there was an account error, and I don’t even have an account. Also, I made a few characters and they fail to load. Finally, I just wish on Pocket Edition you could go back to different updates so I could play like I used to; no bees, no dolphins, no crazy stuff - just how the game started out.

I’ve then watched java and bedrock YT videos up until the point when I downloaded PE this April. One thing I did miss about bedrock though was that the ambience noises were removed. I’m so happy you re-added them with the nether update. I look forward to more updates like the nether update, although not any that are too massive, because people like me (and there are a lot of us) don’t want to lose the simplicity of Minecraft we grew up with. We all want improvements (bug fixes and Java parity specifically on this version) but we don’t massive changes that make Minecraft unrecognizable. For example, the cave update everyone wants, every one expects a massive change but don’t realize it would completely strip Minecraft if it’s simple mining aspect. I am probably the only person in the world who doesn’t want a cave update, but I just don’t want Minecraft to become something else.

For the head, it would be a screen like a TV, changing facial expressions. The TV head would glitch, or bug out whenever the player is caught or damaged. The second costume for Toonbot would be a retro, video game style with a more modern, clean tv instead of an old, 1990 style tv. It would come with a new board witch would simply be a TV remote, special purchasable powers for the board would be zap sideways and super speed. This might add a but of modern-day style to the game.

I don’t play many mobile games and especially match tile types).

You work really hard to get just one star (which I will complain about later) and you choose what you like, but the parents (mostly the dad) are just “eh, it’s nice, but we’re are still gonna sell the house.” It’s like you can’t do anything that’s good enough for them! 3: I do not like the fact that you only get 1 star per game. 1 star!!! We could be making MILLIONS of stars if the game let us get one star every time we make a power-up! It’s just not fair. Now, I love the game, but the thing is that sometimes you’re not there when the game gives you free lives for only 30 minutes. I’m not always there, which in other words, it’s a waste of lives. I myself and maybe other people agree that you should change the game to something else. No offense, the game just needs a bit of a tweak.",That is messed up.,4,True,general,negative,5

I love this game, I’m obsessed, I play all the time and I love it!The concept is great! Ten or so people, most are crewmates, who are supposed to fix the ship and keep an eye on things. A couple, however, are imposters and they are supposed to kill all the crewmates while pretending to be one of them. Its a great game. The concept works great! There are so many strategies to use and its so open ended even with rules in place.But however, the new update may have just ruined things for me. Don’t get me wrong, the quick chat was a good idea, but it doesn’t work as well as you would think. First off, its missing some crucial phrases and questions. Its like impossible to now ask for proof or evidence. If someone doesn’t give it, you can’t get it cause you can’t ask “Proof?” or “Why?”. You also can’t really question people as easily. This makes it very limiting. That wouldn’t be as much of a problem if you could use the free chat too, but now you can’t. As of the update, you cannot use the free chat if you are under 18. This basically ruins the game for all kids. The free chat is good, but not by itself. It extremely limits what you can say and how you get info. It just does not work. Please fix this InnerSloth.

It’s just so fun and addicting. I just got it about three weeks ago and I haven’t stopped playing since. Although it’s a very well made very fun to play game, there’s some things that I think would be cool to add either to among us or among us 2. 1. There should be a way to kick people faster if you’re the host during a game. Some people like to call emergency meetings and waste time, so being able to kick them out would make it go by way faster. 2. I think it would be awesome to add a send a friend request button. Some people have really good friendships on here and a lot of the time one of them might disconnect or have to go and never see each other again! ;( If we had a add friend button, we could always play with them. Plus, when you try to give your personal number or social media’s out to someone, the whole server can see it unless you ban them all. 3. I think I saw this on another review, but maybe add a limit to camera time? It’s kinda hard to kill when people are guarding the cameras. 4. Hackers and exploiters should be automatically banned from playing. Maybe you could install a thing that detects their programming and stuff? They ruin the game a lot. Other than that, this game is amazing! Definitely game of the year.

All my peers were chattering about a seemingly endless canvas, a world so filled with animals and landmarks, yet so empty to the creative mind. A world to be filled with whatever you wish, all in your pocket. To this day, I still believe this is the best purchase I have ever made in my lifetime. Any boring, gloomy day was instantly changed upon starting up this masterpiece of an app. Any player regardless of age has the opportunity to escape to a place where your imagination can flow endlessly. A place to escape the sometimes harsh realities of the real world. I am now a teen in highschool, awaiting my days until graduation as well as my days until adult life. I recently started up the app after years of inactivity due to the minuscule amount of time available for leisure nowadays, especially for the average highschool student. I noticed the changes made to the game. And then when sunset arrived, memories came flooding back. The memories of summer nights spent with friends in this little world that taught us so much. A game that taught us to never put a boundary to our imagination. As I reminisced, I realized how much the game has shaped me as a person. As friends, days, months, and years went in and out of my life, this game has always remained by my side. A lifelong friend. Thank you mojang. Thank you for changing my life.","As I reminisced, I realized how much the game has shaped me as a person.",5,True,enjoyability,positive,4

However I did find more cons than pros. Let’s start off with finding a server. You have three different maps to choose from. You can also choose if you want to play with 1, 2, or 3 imposters. The imposter’s job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with “Confirm Ejects” and “Visual Tasks” on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says “(insert anything here) was not An Imposter” or “was An Imposter”. With it being the imposter’s job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! This game is ruled by immature 12 year olds and when they get accused, they break lose. I am not exaggerating, I have heard the N word, the F word, and so many other ridiculously bad and racist words in this game than I did in the real world. The N word is a word that you will encounter. People think it’s okay if they leave the hard r out but it’s not. The N word is probably the most popular word in this game. I could go on and on but these are the main reasons why I gave it one star","This game is ruled by immature 12 year olds and when they get accused, they break lose.",1,True,general,negative,5

Each update is better then the last, adding amazing animals and new objects. However I have noticed in the recent update, TONS of new bugs and issues have occurred. Such as, sometimes when I am crafting something, I craft it and then go back in the crafting table. But my item is still there. I try to remove it, but it just replaces itself with another one. I end having to close the app and reopen it. Another problem that has recently developed is, whenever I go into chat when I am on a sever, my game immediately freezes, then crashes and knocks me out of the app. Another thing that has recently happened is when I am playing and go into my inventory, it freezes and won’t unfreeze. One more is, sometimes when I go into the nether, it stays frozen on the “loading terrain” screen. Other than these glitches and bugs, I HIGHLY recommend this game. Whenever I want to play a fun game, this will always be my first choice. With the endless building ideas, the challenge of defeating the bosses, and playing countless games and tests Minecraft is the best game out there and will make you play for hours.

I am not rating it based on gameplay, because that would mean that it would be five stars. My  2 star review is because of the community. Now, the reason it’s not 1 Star is because I met some really good people. Like IJevI, they were kind, friendly, and nice. They wouldn’t even kill me if he was the impostor. He would legit kill everyone else and leave me be. So I did the same. But on the other hand, ITS RADIOACTIVE ☢️ X TOXIC X 1,000,000.

That is absolutely unacceptable. I am not giving up among us, just warning y’all of the murky waters ahead if you get this. Add friend system!!! I want friend system!!! Don’t do so in the next update, and I am telling my friends it’s a bad game, it is sparse in terms of account management (cuz there is no account managements or accounts at all) it has a toxic community, and can have bad connections sometimes.

Also most of the time after we vote it all goes black and I just hear the sound of people leaving the game so I don’t know if that’s what is happening to other people too and that’s why I hear leaving but none the less it is a glitch that needs to be patched up.

Another thing on the Polus map, the lava is gone, I see the bubbles still but the actual lava is not there.

It is fun and easy to learn how to play, and it kills time while making us think. I believe the new tournaments are fun, but it needs more. The levels need to make it so more coins can be earned. If I earn the minimum coins per level (50) and play 10 levels, it still isn’t enough to get a retry on a particularly hard level. Now I do think the fact they are called “Hard Levels” makes it better for us to prepare, and definitely the coin amount there is worth it. But in order to pass a level, I spend almost 6-8 hearts if it’s extremely time-consuming and hard. There is still the issue with more prizes. I like the daily bonus, but after the seventh day, it sent me right back to the first day without any prizes. I believe it should be after the 7th day, you get all the prizes from day 1-6 at the same time, and then day 8 and on should have more until you reach every seventh day again. It’s a good way to make people play the game. There also need to be more tournaments that don’t give prizes based off places. I never get first place in the plane tournament, but in the knitting ball one, I got a lot of prizes and it made me feel more encouraged to try.

Thanks you reading this and I would recommend this game for anyone, even if these suggestions don’t happen!After Update:The update is, well, weird. The cameras on Polus have glitches all over them so when some walks on camera there is a million copies of them and on some areas, two different camera sections collide and look very weird. The chat, I like that you have the quick chat, but I really don’t like that we still can’t just type. It’s so hard to find what you want to say and by the time you find it, everyone has already voted. Also on the Polus map, the names do disappear, but I kinda like it because you can hide. Another thing on the Polus map, the lava is gone, I see the bubbles still but the actual lava is not there. One last thing, when I am a ghost, I sometimes like to go outside of the map, but I noticed that now there is no wall keeping me from going away too far, can you please bring that wall back? Thanks!","Also on the Polus map, the names do disappear, but I kinda like it because you can hide.",5,True,effectiveness,positive,2

I often keep my tablet in monochrome setting and for the most part this doesn’t inhibit game play as the shapes are so different. However the ice bombs are all the same shape and in grayscale I cannot tell them apart as they are too close in tone to their one another and not identical in tone to the matching shape. It is frustrating.On a completely different note. I am convinced Austin is dead and this whole game is an afterlife experience. Otherwise the back story of him as a butler (second generation no less) whose family as this fabulous history and mansion makes very little sense. The butler conceit causes other problems as well. I HATE having to spend stars to sweep or dust when Austin sweeps to “alienate boredom,” and often enough to warrant concerns about it being an obsessive behavior... maybe he isn’t dead, maybe his parents sent him to a special program for individuals with extreme obsessive behavior, the Institute wasn’t a school for butlers, it was an institution for individuals with special needs such as delusional thinking and obsessive behavior.",It is frustrating.,4,True,general,negative,5

I’ve seen lots of other reviews saying this and I 100% agree with them: there needs to be a chat log or some way of communicating with other players. There also needs to be a friends list where you can add someone if you like them, because as of now you just lose that person forever. There also needs to be (this is the feature I want the most) to be a statistics option where you can see how many wins and losses, minutes played etc. and lastly, there should be a clock on the top of the screen, because when you exit this app, maybe to check the time, it disconnects you from the game entirely.

This has happened to me twice before, and each time I had multiple very accomplished worlds. What happens is that one second, it’s working just fine, and then when you try to get on it next time, you can’t even make it to the loading screen without it crashing. When this happens, it keeps happening, and you can’t get onto your Minecraft, not even onto your home screen, so you can try to find out what is wrong. Every time this happens to me, it is completely hopeless, and I end up deleting Minecraft. Then, when I redownload it, I lose all of my worlds, skins, servers, and everything except your Xbox live account, which you have to log back into. It is the most annoying thing ever, and I hate it so much. The reason I am actually writing this review is because I am hoping someone at Mojang will see it, and try to troubleshoot the problem. Also, when I tried to look up my problem on Minecraft forums, it looked like a bunch of other people have had the exact same problem, and it’s not getting fixed. If this problem doesn’t get fixed, I’m deleting Minecraft altogether because it was a complete waste of my money.

One of my biggest complaints is the fact that you cannot do something as little as pull down your notification screen a smidge without being forced to bear a 20 second+ dimmed out “Rejoining game...” screen. That’s ridiculous. Why should it take that long to get back in the game when I hardly even left? The connection errors/bugs are ridiculous and make it rare to get a solid game in. That’s unacceptable, really. What’s the point in playing a game that’s likely to crash because of bugs? Also, the lack of any form of communication between players is upsetting. Seriously, no chat box? No ability to use our microphones? You want to charge $4 for a board game and not let us speak to each other? They’re also charging $30 for a season pass that I believe features strictly cosmetics. 🙄 Marmalade, if you want our money at least give us a solid game. Another complaint I have is the only games rules we have to choose from are: Classic and Quick mode. It would be nice to have the options to change the rules/play custom games and whatnot. To the Monopoly fans, tread carefully because this game was clearly developed as a cash grab and not to give us the mobile Monopoly we would expect in 2020. The base gameplay is acceptable, but the flaws make the game close to unplayable.",What’s the point in playing a game that’s likely to crash because of bugs?,1,True,general,negative,5

My friends and I agreed that it would make it a lot of fun if there was some type of chat within the game, even if its just an emoji chat for when certain actions occur during the game. Also, there should be some sort of stats chart or perfomance chart at the end or during a persons overall experience. Winning is fun but being able to show it off is funner. Lastly, why make a new board and the metal figures so expensive? im sure some people might have purchased them but you guys could be making bigger profits if those prices were cheaper, perhaps 3 figures for a dollar... and expand the number of figures avail.

It’s annoying I’ve only had this game for a week and I’m uninstalling it. You need stars to complete tasks and you only get one when u pass the level. As u rank up the more stars  u need to complete ONE task it’s not fair. Also I downloaded the game mainly to be able to redecorate the house and once you finish the kitchen you get sent outside to build the garden/ greenhouse. It is the most boring part of the game that takes FOREVER to finish. You can finish a room in 1-3 days of completion. But the outside has taken 6+ days to work on and I finally just gave up because of how many unnecessary tasks you have to complete just to get through one day. Every time u think your finally done with the outside theirs something stupid you have to still do. This game is only fun for a few days after that it’ll just make you want to throw your phone in the garbage. Also the amount of coins you get for each level is unbelievable you should be able to get more the higher you level up but nope they just want you to try to buy their packages. Something no game will ever get out of me. As soon as games start to cheat you into wanting to spend your real money is when it gets deleted from my phone.

I remember surprise Friday or Friday surprise, but then it stopped. Until an exception- Surprise Saturday. Ah yes. I remember why polar bears were added in the game, and the reason. Jeb’s wife (I think it’s Jeb’s..) liked polar bears, so that’s why they were added. The original Mobil lite version, and I remember when Minecraft PE was free. All this time it’s been downloaded in my cloud storage, so I never had to buy it. (Heh) This game never stops improving. But of course, I’m more of a Java version myself, of course. The days of me and the boys, staying up all night, gaming, building whatever we could. I also remember the day when Microsoft bought Mojang, or did they buy Minecraft? Anyways. The first minecon was about 30 people, mostly Notches’ family. The good ol days of Minecraft. A few things could be changed though.

It’s so fun and the strategy involved makes it more exciting to play. It also gives such a rush of adrenaline. But whilst this game is structured beautifully and an incredible game, I do have a few small tips that I think could make this game better than it already is. First of all, an add friend button. Me and my friends love playing servers together and being able to friend other users could make it easier to game together. Also a microphone feature would be great. Chatting with the other users whilst playing out loud could be really great, because you’d be talking instead of typing through a screen. You’d be able to pick a game with microphone chatting or without, just whatever you prefer personally. Also being to branch out into private chats with people in the server would be really good. That way you could discuss plans with fellow imposters and win in a better and more strategized way. Also you could chat with friends you’re playing with separately. It would add a better feature of strategy and even betrayal to the game. You could even use it for persuasion purposes. Those are a few small but very effective features I think us among us users would love and highly appreciate!

Unfortunately, the lives replenish slowly with no way to decrease the time limit.  I would love to see the developers decrease the life refresh rate per 100 levels completed, for example.

But when you have 10 more moves left and you win the level you are lucky to win 58 coins?!?!  And you just better break out your dollars because some levels you will be killing yourselves to win. Like 498 level I am not going to spend anymore money on this game. And the few moves it gives you to play and the purple blocks that has the bugs in them good luck they get much harder in higher up levels. This level it has the regular white blocks that grow but the purple ones you have to kit them 2 to 3 times and they grow back just one to two moves after you remove another side. To get extra coins for more lives or boosters it is a lot of money for what little you get. 900 coins you get 3 this. And 1900 coins you get 3 globes. The lives run out so fast and sometimes my friends send me lives I see them and play one game go back to collect the life because it won’t allow you to have 6 life’s and it is missing. I am in the room right at the stairs I forget what it is called. Looks like another living room to me. The outside green house it felt like it took years to finish the plot line. I wish you could request the boosters but place them where you want them if you want them in the game. Like they would be added to your side menu but not dropped down in the puzzle because it places them and there would be a awesome move but the boosters messed it up and you only can use the boosters there is no other move.,And you just better break out your dollars because some levels you will be killing yourselves to win.,2,True,cost,negative,1

There are a few problems though. To name a few, when you use an ad to revive, sometimes you will respawn you end up in an area where you are supposed to be on top of a train, so all 3 lanes have trains coming at you just to kill you again and the only way to survive is to waste a board so you can crash into a train. Also, parts of the game don’t make sense. For example, you’ll jump over a barrier and then you’ll see a train going down the same lane where the barrier is just to run over it. Trains will also appear out of nowhere. Keys are another huge problem. They are so rare to find and then if you don’t want to watch an ad to revive, you have to pay at least one key. As you keep dying, you need more and more keys to the point where the amount needed is insanely high. I also would like to see the game have challenges instead of only being able to run on an endless road.

Don’t get me wrong they’re great characters, but bumping down the price a little wouldn’t hurt. The second suggestion is offering more discounts on things like coins and prize boxes in the game. Maybe you could even call it Discount Day or Discount Week. The last suggestion is putting more missions in the game. Like for example, having the game players find LIMITED EDITION Gold boxes along the trail, that are filled with SUPER RARE things like unlocking special characters or getting a BIG amount of gems or coins. Other than these few suggestions, this game is amazingly fun! I like how it travels around the world to a new location every other month, and has characters that you buy from that specific location to go along with the theme!

I’d like to believe that this app has not even scratched the surface of it’s potential to be incredibly fun, and highly social. The only customization is being able to select what you play as before a game and what map you use, but what about having your own profile and being able to search up other people? What about leaderboards to see other friends or leagues that you’re able to participate in? The menu is so bland, and it is so very clear that a lot more can be added to make it much more engaging and addictive. Personal daily challenges & achievements.

But, I would like to request a feature. Could there be an option to have more intelligent crew mates/impostors in free play? For example: I start up free play and see an option saying “would you like to turn on intelligent mode?” I turn it on and free play starts. It has usual free play features like picking tasks and being the impostor. But with one major difference: the AI is more intelligent. I’ll give you a look at both sides of this mode. CREWMATE VIEW:You run around doing tasks with the other AI crew mates. And one of the crew mates is the impostor. The impostor’s AI does intelligent stuff like: trapping you in rooms, sabotaging electricity and such, and so much more! IMPOSTOR VIEW:The crew mates are doing tasks. While your the impostor. You take down the AI crew mates and such. But the AI crew mates does intelligent things like the AI impostor. Like:Reporting dead bodies, calling emergency meetings, and so much more! I would love to see all of this added into free play mode. I will be awaiting your response.EDIT:Ok, I think a great feature to have would be when the impostor kills you and your pet cries, you can comfort it. Like pet it and tell it everything is gonna be okay. Then it’s happy and it starts following your ghost. I would love this feature. Once again, I will be awaiting your response.—Your biggest fan",CREWMATE VIEW:You run around doing tasks with the other AI crew mates.,5,True,general,positive,5

I just played a game with my fiancé, where we both got into a online multiplayer lobby (why is there no option to bring friends into online multiplayer) so when we were playing im not sure what happened but it ended up freezing for her without ANY notice to me. On her phone it was frozen she had to close app, for me it seemed as if she was playing just fine. Before it froze she told me she landed on me as i wasnt paying attention but on my screen no one landed on me. Its 100% off sync on her phone i had $250 on my phone i had $77. Theres so many more bugs im sure u guys been told by now. And so many more things you guys can improve on. So heres what I did. I made a community ran subreddit for this game i’d love for some of you’re companies employees to join. Its r/monopolymobilewe can easily get the subreddit to grow and i can get a list of complaints/bugs/suggestions/glitches sent from players to you guys as theres no direct way to get these sent so people know you guys are listening.

It’s annoying I’ve only had this game for a week and I’m uninstalling it. You need stars to complete tasks and you only get one when u pass the level. As u rank up the more stars  u need to complete ONE task it’s not fair. Also I downloaded the game mainly to be able to redecorate the house and once you finish the kitchen you get sent outside to build the garden/ greenhouse. It is the most boring part of the game that takes FOREVER to finish. You can finish a room in 1-3 days of completion. But the outside has taken 6+ days to work on and I finally just gave up because of how many unnecessary tasks you have to complete just to get through one day. Every time u think your finally done with the outside theirs something stupid you have to still do. This game is only fun for a few days after that it’ll just make you want to throw your phone in the garbage. Also the amount of coins you get for each level is unbelievable you should be able to get more the higher you level up but nope they just want you to try to buy their packages. Something no game will ever get out of me. As soon as games start to cheat you into wanting to spend your real money is when it gets deleted from my phone. I recommend finding another game to play unless you have plenty of patience for bull*hit.,This game is only fun for a few days after that it’ll just make you want to throw your phone in the garbage.,2,True,enjoyability,positive,4

However, I would really like to see some better incentives to keep players in the game. For some of the side challenges (e.g. knitting), the rewards, such as unlimited lives for a certain period of time, are given immediately. If I had the option to save that reward for a rainy day, perhaps when I’m tackling a particularly difficult level, I’d be more inclined to play for longer periods of time. When this happens, however, it’s almost always the case that I don’t have the time to actually use said reward and it ends up being useless. I’d also like to see the coin rewards have a better balance. 50-70 coins as a reward for each level won? Come on! What about an additional ten or so coins for each remaining turn? Say if I’ve beaten a level and I have five turns left. I should win the base coins of fifty and then an additional fifty for each turn I didn’t use. For harder levels, base coins of 100 and then an additional fifty coins for each additional remaining turn. Now THAT’S an incentive! That would be rad. Otherwise, fun game!","I’ve been playing this game for a while and it’s enjoyable, occasionally challenging, and a good way to kill some time.",4,True,learnability,positive,6

It was really fun just trying to get the highest run and the biggest amount of coins. But then, a couple of years after the app came into being, it's levels changed up. It gained new challenges and new characters which did help the game but that classic opening was almost completely gone. I come back a few years later and they are still doing the tour. I mean how long does a tour around the world really take? And now, there are slightly better graphics but it's not the same. There is an ad after almost every run. If you want it to be like majority of the other running games going around right now then this game is definitely for you. It is still fun but the ads have turned me away.

I mean of all the the video games, why did my first one have to be this? Well, I actually got introduced by my classmates , whom have recently discovered the game. When we would ask what did you do for the weekend Amoung us would be a popular game they all played. After a while, I found myself wanting to play the game more and more. I downloaded the app and found myself loving it! The game was relatively easy to play, and fun. While, I enjoyed the game their were still some downsides. One of the major cons was the gaming community in the app. People can have offensive name, and bully people without getting kicked out of the game. Many of the hosts do not seem bothered by this,  and don’t even think to ban or kick these people from the game.  As time went by I found the game less entertaining and it became boring. Even with the different maps, which I have tried; all the game is finish task look off suspicion and repeat. I really thought it be more of a challenge. It is challenging in its own way though, like collaboration with people. It can be hard to reason with people. For the reasons above , I quite the game.

So, first off I would like to start this review off with talking about how much I love this game. I downloaded this game years ago and still love it. It’s ultimately a great game. Here’s some of my requests you should do. First off, could you guys please make the game where you don’t need wifi to be able to join people? It always makes road trips boring for me if I want to play minecraft with a friend. Also, if you guys could make it where people can share a wolf. My first wolf from the beginning passed away tonight due to a skeleton attack. Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone’s been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful. Also if you could make it where villagers, foxes, and mobs can be leashed. That’s all my requests for now. Thank you!",It’s ultimately a great game.,5,True,general,positive,5

It makes you push yourself harder and harder to beat the other people’s high score. This gets you in a competitive mood and makes the game much more fun.#3: Unlocking characters and boards is another way to have more fun in the game. You collect keys and coins over and over until you have enough to unlock that character that you just HAD to have. This gives you another thing to work towards.Although the game has many fun features, it also has a few problems. Here is why I left off two stars#1: Let me set the scene: You’ve seen everybody else have subway surf, so you beg your mom to let you get it. She says yes, so you go to the App Store and download it. You start playing and realize how addicting it is!! You play nonstop for hours. *2 months later* You haven’t played in a bit, so you open up the app and start playing. You instantly get bored. The problem with this game is that you do the same thing over and over again, different setting or not. It gets very boring. #2: You can’t get all the characters. Some of them cost money , and some of them you have to have a certain social media for, and some people aren’t old enough to have FaceBook or whatever.Overall it’s a fun game but don’t plan on it being addicting for very long",It gets very boring.,3,True,enjoyability,negative,4

If you’ve seen any ad for this game then you’ve probably saw the “pull the the pins” type of gameplay presented to draw you in. That’s NOT what this game is. That type of gameplay is so small & almost insignificant that it’s pretty shady for them to put that at the forefront of their advertising. If you had to pay upfront for this game, I’m pretty sure there would be grounds for a lawsuit; it’s THAT bad. What this game is centered on is the much more generic Candy Crush, “match the tiles” type gameplay. The reason I don’t give it a 1-star is because they have actually made this generic premise fun, and put some admirable twists into the formula (at least I think. I don’t play many mobile games and especially match tile types). Interesting challenges, creative power-ups you can make if you’re smart, genuinely challenging puzzles (in a fun way), admirable special effects & sound design. Doesn’t SEEM to try to force its way into your wallet (from the 12hrs I’ve put into the game thus far) in terms of gameplay, but it does do plenty of in-game marketing.If this game was honest about what it really was, I’d give it 4-stars. But I think A LOT of people will go into this game expecting one thing and getting another, and I think that is a significant knock against the game.","If you had to pay upfront for this game, I’m pretty sure there would be grounds for a lawsuit; it’s THAT bad.",2,True,general,negative,5

Sometimes the normal levels are harder than the hard ones. Not only that but you start by collecting 1 star per game to having to pass multiple levels for one task, which can take 3 stars per task when it used to be 1 Star per task.

Like, everything is supposed to be new, why are they making me waste my stars on a room I had already finished ? And 5 lives isn’t enough!

I mean, it doesn’t even have a part where you can ask for people to watch you do a visual! I also feel like since people can lie about their age, and it isn’t fair to us as kids to let older people be able to say what they want when it seems like they do the most cursing, maybe people can report others that cuss so they would have to use the quick chat for a month or so, since another problem is that it only stops the kids from cursing and explicit stuff, they can still see what other people do if they don’t have censor chat on. As a result of this, in addition to the above suggestion, make it so that the quick chat is an option available, not an unfamiliar thing forced upon us kids.

It’s my “go to” favorite.  I’m somewhere around level 1100 or close to it.  Some levels are hard to the point that it gets ridiculous.  Some of the hard levels are easy or perhaps it’s just luck to win them.  I have spent days on a level and get frustrated and then dont play for a while...but i still really enjoy this game.  You CAN win every level with out a power up.  You DO NOT need to spend any money on this game, patience is a virtue (so they say).  I have spent money and lately I haven’t.  The one thing i do agree with most reviewers on is this... to buy a power up costs wayyy too much money for the amount of coins you receive for passing a level.  To continue a game (at 900 coins) for a move or two costs a fortune considering you really don’t win much.  To buy three hammers costs too much (1900 coins).  I realize they do want you to spend money and i have but even when you spend, it doesn’t give you much in return.

I played MCPE one time for a couple minutes on a friends tablet almost 6 years ago and I’ve been hooked ever since. I’ve then watched java and bedrock YT videos up until the point when I downloaded PE this April. One thing I did miss about bedrock though was that the ambience noises were removed. I’m so happy you re-added them with the nether update. I look forward to more updates like the nether update, although not any that are too massive, because people like me (and there are a lot of us) don’t want to lose the simplicity of Minecraft we grew up with. We all want improvements (bug fixes and Java parity specifically on this version) but we don’t massive changes that make Minecraft unrecognizable. For example, the cave update everyone wants, every one expects a massive change but don’t realize it would completely strip Minecraft if it’s simple mining aspect. I am probably the only person in the world who doesn’t want a cave update, but I just don’t want Minecraft to become something else. I’m sorry this is so long, and I feel bad if any devs actually read this, but I’ve wanted to get this off my chest for a while. Please don’t strip Minecraft’s simplicity from it. This is the game we grew up on, please don’t make it a different game.

I first saw it played on Twitch and said I have got to experience this. The graphics, animation and modeling are really fun. Based on old reviews, I think many issues from the past are solved. The network seems reliable and the rules and variations are pretty much on point. The AI players add a new dimension. They are annoying at worst and a wonderful addition for shrewd dealing humans, at best. The klunky repetitious and nonsensical “offers” they make are pretty bad. And the fact that they only assess deals based on value of the deeds and classifying them as “easy, medium, or hard” just improves their luck and reduces yours makes them pretty frustrating at times. But they’re fun to push around and like I said, they create a whole new dimension in game play. Imagine making a deal with a predictable robot to mess up your human opponent, etc. That said, the overall game feels cold and lonely. How do we know we are really playing against a human when we join Multiplayer online? What is our own record of wins and losses? What if we want to play against a particular player again?

If you play like 5 games in a row with someone and you’re bonding with them, maybe you have to go or maybe they have to go, or if you get kicked or something, you never get to see each other ever again. Also it could be the same thing except with friends. And maybe you can see if you’re friends (in the game) are playing. 3. Newer stuff, like new colors, tasks and hats would be absolutely amazing! I have seen that the developers are working on a new map. 1 question about that. Is it gonna be a hide and seek map? If so that would be the most wonderful thing! Or even just another map even if the one you’re working on isn’t a hide and seek one. I love Among Us and all its features. I very much respect everyone that works on it, and I know it’s hard. But acknowledging at least 1 of the things I listed would be, I can’t even explain.

Great challenge system implemented; giving players “Milestones” looking forward. Games like this can easily be repetitive, the challenge system doesn’t completely take that away but definitely helps. Great app for the current version, runs perfect on my iPhone SE. if I could change anything it would possible be different subway backgrounds to give a different feel for where you maybe few examples “abandoned subway” like the one in Cincinnati Ohio, or New York or Boston type of Subway. I’m sure the devs could possibly implement something of that nature rather simple. Then you could make a “premium” version thus driving more revenue to make more great games. Possibly more power ups to run with, premium players would get access to free power ups once a month maybe 5 of each that can be “stackable” and do not expire. Just a few ideas and an actual helpful review not someone crying about how the game restarted on them or bashing you for bugs that nearly every app will encounter here and there.

At least put it in the update details that it won't work on device x,y, and z (I did have automatic updates on, in fairness, but I have disabled auto-updates now). Honestly, I haven't had my device charged for a few days, and when I did, I turned all the graphics down, etc., and it helped. However, it makes the game very hard to enjoy, pretty much impossible for me. Very disappointed. It still does kick me, and the inventory menu stuff seems laggy and slow still.

This really makes me mad and frustrated because of how many times it’s happened. Next, there is a hacker. You will join a game and the screen will be all black and you can free run wherever. Then when you check the chat it has a link telling you random stuff and to vote for trump. This can be really scary for young ones and we should also not bring any thing political into a game that kids are playing for fun. Also, in the text it says it will hack with your WiFi.

I would really recommend to wait to download the app until these bugs have been fixed. Thankfully, they have said that instead of making an “Amomg us #2” they will wait of and be trying to fix these bugs instead. I would wait until around November, as they said that’s when it should be fixed. I also say you should be 12+ to have this game.

My ONLY complaint, if you play against the AI don’t expect to win. I’ve won once because AI don’t get lucky and this is on EASY AI. You can have an entire side of the board and they will almost always land on a spot that is either safe or really low value. If you own the blue and brown by GO for example, they will often times go to JAIL therefore delaying coming close to those properties. Anytime they land on a CHANCE or COMMUNITY CHEST, they almost always get positive cards. They continuously try to trade you if they need a card so that can be tweaked.

This is not something that is acceptable on a free game but should be corrected immediately on a paid app.  While I enjoy the game, the fact that some many minutes and hours are wasted because games cannot be completed is totally unacceptable.  PLEASE FIX. Really enjoy Monopoly and love the game.  However reading the reviews, I find two issues that have popped up numerous times on other reviews that I am also experiencing also.  Since the last update, I have had several games that just freeze and you are out of luck.  What a waste of one, two hours plus, very frustrating.  The other really big issue is if you purchase the color block of Virginia, St Charles and States,  the Houses and Hotels tab covers Virginia and States and there is no way to add Houses and Hotels.

On another note it would be beneficial to add a friends list feature so you can play with others you meet online as well as people you know in person. Also I’m not a fan of the chat situation. I feel like an open chat forum would allow for more dexterity in the game.

My family thinks I’m insane and I shouldn’t play it as much as I do, but it’s my go to game when I’m bored. But, I recently had some trouble yesterday. So I was saving up for all five of the Christmas people, and I finally got 100 keys, so I got it and then left the app. Then I went back in it later and it said I had 93 keys... I was super confused, so I went into the me section where my boards and characters are to see if I still had my Christmas people, but I accidentally bought a character. And I also had the Christmas people too. After being way too confused I got out for the day. Then, this morning i went on to get my daily snowflakes and words and it wouldn’t let me watch an ad when I died. I had to use keys. Now, I still had 30-something, but if I continued like that, with the amount of time I spend on the game, those keys would be gone super soon.

And if you’re under 13 or whatever age it is, it won’t even let you chose your own name! What’s up with that? However it did have the new map. But with the new update I can only use the quick chat thingy which stinks.

Two really cool characters I would LOVE to have you guys bring back is Mimi and Rabbot. I missed both of them and couldn’t get a chance to have them as characters. Speaking of Mimi, if I’m correct she does have a pet otter which is super cute. I don’t know if the otter runs with her when she is trying to evade the inspector, but if it does I think that the Subway Surfers team should have a pet isle where players can choose an animal to run with them like the inspector has a dog. I would absolutely DIE if that could happen. I also definitely think that younger players would enjoy this. Please consider because I think it will definitely draw more attention to this amazing game. Besides that I think this game has amazing graphics and deserves to have “hype” I also like how you guys make different maps that represent different parts of the world.

I refresh the servers, and there’s barely any. I try another one, same problem. I’m usually spending at least 2-3 minutes just trying to join a game with settings I like.

There’s probably a bunch of people getting impatient, you really gotta hurry up.Suggestions: A friending system, I’ve met so many nice people when playing! It would be nice for a friending system! Another suggestion is more customization, there’s only 12 colors along with a not so massive selection of hats. I’m not allowed to buy anything online, so it would be cool for more customization for people that can’t afford to buy more hats and things! My final suggestion is MORE GAMEMODES!!!

When I went to go mine coal it gave me the ore blocks instead of just coal. I didn’t think much of it until I went to go mine iron and it gave me nothing! This has been happening on every single one of my survival worlds. Maybe because it has Smite 1 on the golden pickaxe but if so why would you give that out to people? I stumbled across a village and went to go see if they had a furnace so I didn’t have to make one. Halfway through making cooking something in the Blast Furnace it just completely stopped. I tried taking everything out and putting them back in but no. I was really annoyed because I needed to cook food! Since it wasn’t working I decided to make a regular furnace. Checked the crafting recipe and it wanted a different block than cobble it wanted ‘Blackstone’? I didn’t even know that existed in the game!

I walk around and when i pull up the pause menu my custom skin is replaced with a random skin. And I sometimes see other players with my skin equipped. And idk if my skin is working or not. Even when i do the inventory menu my custom skin is still there. So Mojang, if you see this then please reach out to me. My Minecraft account is a Xbox live account named Endermen21YT. So please if you can, look into this. Now this could totally just be the server or something else so this might not even be happening.

For those of you who don’t have the game what I mean is that people under 18 have to use the quick chat feature instead of saying whatever. But if you’re over 18 you can use free chat and say whatever you want. I feel that the age limit should be 13 or 14 instead of 18. Like, the majority of this game’s players are under 18 and I don’t think that people over 13 really need that level of “internet safety” protection. Second of all with this new quick chat it takes away some of the things that you want to say about who the imposter is and why you are suspicious of them and whatnot. Some things are so unique you just need to put them in your own words. For example the other day I was playing and I saw Orange running away from a dead body. I reported the body but there was no option to say “(A) was running away from the body.” Some things are so unlikely or one-time happenings that they don’t have options to say it, but when it does happen you can’t do anything about it.

Second, the animations are so annoying!  (Frankly, they were annoying in the old version, too) They are in the way so I can’t see the right side of the board. They are too long and they don’t get shorter when you play a quick game. Third, some of the options in the older version aren’t in the newer one like removing those animations, slight of hand, starting allowance, starting properties, etc.  Fourth, it’s pretty obvious whose turn it is, so I don’t need an obnoxious banner across the screen before every freaking turn!  Finally, the main reason I got this version was because I was hoping the trade AI would get better, but not really. It got slightly better when doing a human to computer trade, but the computer to computer trades are pathetic. It’s like they all gang up to get monopolies so the human can’t get one.

For example, every task around the house goes from costing one star to two. The rewards aren’t sufficient to the amount of boosts being spent on harder levels. Some levels are so hard and waste so many lives that you have to use boosts just to get through it. There should be more levels that don’t take multiple tries to get through. Some of the tasks that the game makes you do are stupid. The game is trying to get you to use all your stars so you have to play more, which is typical, but with the levels so hard, it’s really just a tactic to get people to spend more money. It’s also takes way too long for the lives to reload. It’s like 25mins per life. I really liked this game at the start but the further I’ve gotten, the less I want to continue playing. Instead of throwing in so many different aspects into the puzzle games so soon, they should have waited and made it harder much later. I’m only in the kitchen and I spend on average 3-5 lives on each level. I try not to use boosters because they are so hard to earn. Paying 900coins to get 5 more moves on one level, when each level earns you roughly 50-70 coins (hard levels earn you 100+) is just sad. In conclusion, this game only remains fun for the first 60 levels then gets frustrating.

So, first off I would like to start this review off with talking about how much I love this game. I downloaded this game years ago and still love it. It’s ultimately a great game. Here’s some of my requests you should do. First off, could you guys please make the game where you don’t need wifi to be able to join people? It always makes road trips boring for me if I want to play minecraft with a friend. Also, if you guys could make it where people can share a wolf. My first wolf from the beginning passed away tonight due to a skeleton attack. Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone’s been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful. Also if you could make it where villagers, foxes, and mobs can be leashed. That’s all my requests for now. Thank you!","Also, if you guys could make it where people can share a wolf.",5,True,general,positive,5

But I have suggestions, can you add a friending thing? Like where you can friend people so u to it can play with them again. Like if you know the person in real life or if you liked playing with them! I also really think you should at least have one pet for free, the mini Crewmate is like and icon for the game, but then you download it and found out you have to pay to get it. Thanks you reading this and I would recommend this game for anyone, even if these suggestions don’t happen!After Update:The update is, well, weird. The cameras on Polus have glitches all over them so when some walks on camera there is a million copies of them and on some areas, two different camera sections collide and look very weird. The chat, I like that you have the quick chat, but I really don’t like that we still can’t just type. It’s so hard to find what you want to say and by the time you find it, everyone has already voted. Also on the Polus map, the names do disappear, but I kinda like it because you can hide. Another thing on the Polus map, the lava is gone, I see the bubbles still but the actual lava is not there. One last thing, when I am a ghost, I sometimes like to go outside of the map, but I noticed that now there is no wall keeping me from going away too far, can you please bring that wall back?

Maybe if you let people type in some things but not everything like ‘you are an idiot!’ that would be double awesome!!

I have a few suggestions for things you could add or fix. My first thing and biggest thing is a friends list because sometimes when your playing you meet this awesome person but then one of you have to go and you will never see that person that you bonded with again. Another thing is new colors, hats, and pets. I think there should be a wider variety of colors including gray, dark red, light purple, and a tie color could be awesome! There should be additional hats added as well like a set of head phones, glasses, new wigs, and a set of pretty wings. I also think that there should be more pets and pets that you don’t have to pay for or like watch a certain amount of adds to unlock this pet or do this to unlock this pet. I think they should add a poddle pet, cat, and a bird would be cool. Something that kinda bothers me is that Mirah HQ (probably spelled wrong) doesn’t have cameras in it. I have also encountered some people who have asked sexual questions and wanted to do sexual activity I know that you can’t really do anything about that but I wanted to put that out there.

Board games in reality are fixed in many ways. For example, a deck of cards with a discard pile ensured that every card in the game will be played before a player can draw a second copy of any card. This also ensures equal odds of getting a card. This app takes the simpler approach of randomly generating the card on each draw. This means you may draw cards like “Speeding Fine” two or three times in a row, while never pulling “Advance To...” cards of any kind. The odds of card drawing seem to also favor the weaker cards. The developers assure that’s not true, but an easy way to restore faith would be to have the cards work with an actual deck and discard system instead of random generation upon each draw. To me, the purpose of this is to mimic the board game, if you wanted to change the fundamentals of the game then a different game mode would be nice. A “Randomized” mode could be fun along with the original two, but I would want the “Classic” mode to run like the classic board game. Otherwise, the game is functionally okay. Some cards do not work as intended, like cards that require paying between players, but most major bugs have been worked out.

I tried taking everything out and putting them back in but no. I was really annoyed because I needed to cook food! Since it wasn’t working I decided to make a regular furnace. Checked the crafting recipe and it wanted a different block than cobble it wanted ‘Blackstone’? I didn’t even know that existed in the game!

Firstly, disconnections are frequent; in a game whose structure relies upon every player living long enough to cast out the killer(s) before meeting either win/loss condition, losing those players to disconnection means one less pair of hands for tasks, one less vote per meeting, one less identity to hide among, or one less partner to kill crewmates. If it were just one, a person could grouse and learn to get over it. But it is many. The problem is large enough to merit redress. And there are game-ending graphical errors, too. From time to time, avatars glitch through/into walls, or walk into out-of-bounds areas. I even lost a game once where I thought I broke another player’s alibi because she claimed to be someplace, but she was plainly visible right next to me. Turns out she wasn’t a liar—my game was just glitchy.

I’d like to be able to use 100 coins for each move I want to add. I might only use one more move to win and I just wasted 900 coins or it takes me 6 moves but to up the ante a second time costs another 1200 coins. How often do people use the 2100 coins for an extra 10 moves and if they do, did it take them another 5 moves to win or just 1? Let us dish out 100 coins at a time or buy more bombs or something.

What I love about this game is how they make it have a really cool theme. The characters are all so cool and at the start You are spray painting and the police come running after you. Sometimes I feel like I am in the game itself. I like how they give you head starters and the font and if you die they sometime let you come back alive after just watching a video. The only down side about the game is he hover boards and the characters are all SO MANY coins and keys. I am never able to get that many coins and keys. I just try to get enough coins to get the character Lucy, and her scary outfit or whatever it is called. Then I just play the game and like a month later I will try to see how much I can pay for.

This app appears to be too similar to Candy Crush. But it has different things to do. And this is also having similar power ups.

It is very entertaining and sometimes I spend hours in a day playing it. The levels seem to get really difficult after you start renovating the third room. I really find it so frustrating that we have to wait 30 minutes for each life to come back. Also, the amount of moves given in each level is ridiculous. Sometimes, you need just 2 more moves to pass the level and you can’t because you’re out of moves. Then, if you want more, you have to pay 900 coins for only five more moves. And if you don’t have the money, you have to forfeit and loose the game. Other times, you can join competitions and get really cool power ups. If I get stuck on one of the levels in the challenges, I loose all my prizes and earned money. The point of the game is to be fun and decorate a house, which honestly is my favorite part of the game. Don’t get me wrong, the matching part of the game is so fun too, I just hate the fact that you have to wait so long to get lives and some of the tasks they ask you to do are just ridiculous.

The computer makes trades amongst themselves that aren’t fair, they’re only helping each other get sets to knock you out of the game. If you have hotels, the AI WILL NOT LAND ON THEM.

I had a property of every color in my last game to ensure no one can build, so what happens? Yup, I land on their railroads only. So what do I do? I buy one of their railroads for a ridiculous price. The next turn, the computer acquired a railroad from another computer to re up the price. I know what you are thinking, why wouldn’t they buy that railroad prior so that they had all 4?

It gets annoying when I join only to be wearing their skin. Another thing is that the game constantly kicks me out. I’ll be playing and my screen will freeze a lot.

I offered everything I had plus ONE THOUSAND dollars and the AI refused my trade. The next turn he rolled, landed on Boardwalk, completed the set, and put several houses on each.

I mean of all the the video games, why did my first one have to be this? Well, I actually got introduced by my classmates , whom have recently discovered the game. When we would ask what did you do for the weekend Amoung us would be a popular game they all played. After a while, I found myself wanting to play the game more and more. I downloaded the app and found myself loving it! The game was relatively easy to play, and fun. While, I enjoyed the game their were still some downsides. One of the major cons was the gaming community in the app. People can have offensive name, and bully people without getting kicked out of the game. Many of the hosts do not seem bothered by this,  and don’t even think to ban or kick these people from the game.  As time went by I found the game less entertaining and it became boring. Even with the different maps, which I have tried; all the game is finish task look off suspicion and repeat. I really thought it be more of a challenge. It is challenging in its own way though, like collaboration with people. It can be hard to reason with people. For the reasons above , I quite the game. I still, want to give a shout out to the game developers for providing some fun, and hope they pay attention to my complaints. Thank you!","Well, I actually got introduced by my classmates , whom have recently discovered the game.",3,True,cost,negative,1

I play this game so much and I became obsessed with getting diamond medals since it’s so time consuming and I have so much fun trying to get the top Run. Now that the top run table never appears for me I’ve became extremely frustrated. I tried for a week already and nothing works. Also I can’t compete with my friend who’s really into this game too, since my Facebook friends won’t show up. I read somewhere to remove the game from Facebook and then log in into Facebook again, I’ve done that numerous times and it still doesn’t show my friends. Also after a while of trying to connect the app with my Facebook account, the option of doing so on settings disappeared. I’m pretty sure there’s very smart ppl running the game, and I ask that you please look into it. I ask that you please make an update and fix this issue.

It is so addicting and I love playing it with my friends. I would 100% recommend this game. I would give it 5 stars, however there are three things I would love to see added. The first one is a friends system because it would be a lot easier to join a friend’s game if you could just click ‘join game’ like in roblox. A second thing I would love to see added is a currency like coins or maybe something more creative like aliens. Then, players should receive say, 5 aliens or coins if they win as a crew mate and 10 aliens or coins if they win as imposter. Then, I think players should be able to use these coins/aliens to buy hats or outfits. I also think it would be really cool if we could use this currency to buy higher imposter chances because I would love if I could do that. The third and final thing I would love to see added is a report button. This would be good because I have noticed that some people say weird or disturbing things in my games quite often. I know the creators can’t control what people say, but it would be nice if they could be reported for it. Overall, I love among us but I would love to see these three things added. P.S.

My high score was like 80,000. Well HIGHER! They completely reset my high score. At first I was confused because I was proud of my high score, and trying to beat it, but then IT GOT RESET!

The only reason why because we have to fix the house. I don’t know why else. But it can also be dived into sections of the game. This is what a like so much.

This includes pop-up notifications for texts, emails, phone calls, other apps, anything. And especially don’t think about quickly exiting the app for any reason, that’s a guaranteed disconnect. But even if you play the game without distractions, certain mechanics start to breakdown after enough time passes. You’ll draw Community Chest cards to pay $50 only for the debt to not be taken from your account. You’ll roll the dice only for them to disappear and your turn to never end, the token never moving and it being impossible to reroll the dice. You’ll make a trade offer, only for the game to freeze and be impossible to resume.My friends have so much fun playing on the app, but have only successfully completed a handful of games since the app’s release.

One last thing, smart AI for Freeplay. I read someone else’s review and I too would love to have smarter AI as an option. This game is amazing. Edit: so I just had an idea. For the Charles headphone hat, maybe there could be an alternative broken headphones because of the Valiant Hero ending? Edit 2: sorry if a bunch of people are dumping a lot of ideas in you, but I had an idea just now. What if there are different body types for different kill animations? For example, if the impostor literally backstabs you, your body could be face down on the floor with their hand reaching out. Or when the impostor impales you with their tongue, it could be a body with a hole in its head. Thanks for reading!

Board games in reality are fixed in many ways. For example, a deck of cards with a discard pile ensured that every card in the game will be played before a player can draw a second copy of any card. This also ensures equal odds of getting a card. This app takes the simpler approach of randomly generating the card on each draw. This means you may draw cards like “Speeding Fine” two or three times in a row, while never pulling “Advance To...” cards of any kind. The odds of card drawing seem to also favor the weaker cards. The developers assure that’s not true, but an easy way to restore faith would be to have the cards work with an actual deck and discard system instead of random generation upon each draw. To me, the purpose of this is to mimic the board game, if you wanted to change the fundamentals of the game then a different game mode would be nice. A “Randomized” mode could be fun along with the original two, but I would want the “Classic” mode to run like the classic board game. Otherwise, the game is functionally okay.

Mobile edition crashes all the time, everything is super laggy when more players join the game. Don’t get me started on the bugs it makes the game worthless.

It’s not the employees fault as I have made friends with them over the years and they are hardworking people who don’t have the resources and support they need.

Give us a chance to win coins back.   I gave you 4 stars yet I will delete this game because of inability to win without paying big money, but here is a big thought that may help your creators.  Give bonus random coins for no reason or a closing jackpot at the end of each game or Room.  To spend and spend and never win anything back except 50 coins to 100 coins is disheartening.

Just an interesting spin to make the game a little more addictive.  The little side quests like trophy challenges and the parrot gifts are super helpful. However I will say sometimes you are gifted 30 min unlimited game play and you don’t really have an option of when to use it. So if I am getting in a quick game on a break or before dinner and I am gifted one of those it goes to waste if I can’t continue to play for an extra 30 min.  Not going to lie, at those moments It really is frustrating because you get only 5 lives and the regeneration rate is slow. In addition the buy rate for items feels a little high. As an example to buy an extra 5 moves at the end of a tough level is 900 coins. You maybe get 55 coins for beating a level. So you have to tear through 18 levels to earn enough to buy that extension.  It actually de-incentivizes me to buy a package because it never really feels like you are getting a deal.  That being said if you can play and not get frustrated when you get stuck on a level for days, or are willing to pay for buy ups this game rocks.","The match game itself feels pretty comparable to others, what I enjoy though is that beating a level allows you to make transformations.",4,True,effectiveness,positive,2

This time the app completely crashes every time it loads. It sends me right back to my home screen. Seriously. Someone help me out here. These sort of bugs have happened multiple times. I’ve notified mojang and they just told me to delete and reinstall the app. They SHOULDN’T have to tell me to DELETE the app. All the hard work 😂😓. Anyway, thank you for reading my comment.

This takes talent. The only way is that we did our skills. And the puzzles facing our ways. That’s the concert. To be honest, it also has days. This never happened in most games in my life. The only reason why because we have to fix the house. I don’t know why else. But it can also be dived into sections of the game. This is what a like so much. This app appears to be too similar to Candy Crush. But it has different things to do. And this is also having similar power ups. One more thing before closing the review. 900 coins is a lot for 5 moves. I think you need 1/3 of the amount (300 coins) and save 900 coins for 5 more moves and another thing.

However, I would really like to see some better incentives to keep players in the game. For some of the side challenges (e.g. knitting), the rewards, such as unlimited lives for a certain period of time, are given immediately. If I had the option to save that reward for a rainy day, perhaps when I’m tackling a particularly difficult level, I’d be more inclined to play for longer periods of time. When this happens, however, it’s almost always the case that I don’t have the time to actually use said reward and it ends up being useless. I’d also like to see the coin rewards have a better balance. 50-70 coins as a reward for each level won? Come on! What about an additional ten or so coins for each remaining turn? Say if I’ve beaten a level and I have five turns left. I should win the base coins of fifty and then an additional fifty for each turn I didn’t use. For harder levels, base coins of 100 and then an additional fifty coins for each additional remaining turn. Now THAT’S an incentive! That would be rad. Otherwise, fun game!","When this happens, however, it’s almost always the case that I don’t have the time to actually use said reward and it ends up being useless.",4,True,cost,negative,1

I love the dolphins and turtles but couldn’t they add a few more like perhaps turkey or peacocks. I know you can easily get mods for these things but some cost money. I also think that they should add more dog breeds if there weren’t just a wolf I would have a lot more dogs. Like maybe they could have huskies pugs Pomeranians Shibas Chiwawas and Great Danes these are all great dog breeds. They could have which dog you get by the color of the wolf you tame like huskies would be white wolfs and Great Danes could be brown wolfs. I think you should also be able to tame polar bears turtles and dolphins and after you tame them you can saddle them and ride them. I also think that fish bowls should be a thing because if you catch a fish than you can put it in a fish bowl and depending on the amount of glass you use you get a different sized fish bowl.

I can fairly say that it is a well-executed game with consistent updates and support. I like the creative side as well as the puzzle side it’s a nice balance. One thing everyone should know unequivocally before beginning, however, is that the developers hate the players. Hate may not even be a strong enough word for it. I could be wrong, maybe it’s impossible to fairly balance a puzzle game but to program it so much in the favor of you losing is... unsurprising considering how often it wants you to purchase things. Now, you don’t have ads in this game, which is nice, and the options to purchase don’t ensure victory (I mean at all), so in a sense the game is consistent and there’s some comfort in that. The reward system is pretty rough, it does sometimes feel like an endless attempt to wear you down. You will rage quit from time to time, or put it down for a couple months, but this is a casual game. Whereas other games make me feel as if they’ve earned my business, I find the challenge of this one is seeing how far I can go without spending any money, because it tries so hard.

Currently, there are bugs that prevent games from being finished, and these bugs can happen after you’ve played for 30 minutes or more. For example, if somebody owes money, and they try to make another deal to raise more money, this seems to stop the game. It seems to lose track of whose turn it is (and who is still owed money). Sometimes, if someone refuses all your deals for that turn, it ends your turn for some reason, but the End Turn button is still shown. Pressing End Turn at this point stops the game. If you are low on battery life and get a battery warning, it can disconnect you from the game. Also, players sometimes stop playing, and there’s no warning or way to resign without stopping the game for everyone. In spite of these flaws, it’s a fun game, but there’s room for improvement.

Also in the football deck, a card erroneously lists the “Stanford Cardinals.” Its singular: “Cardinal.” When this card comes up, we suddenly realize that the creator of the deck doesn’t know college football.",It’s the only game I’ve ever paid for extras.,4,True,cost,negative,1

Thankyou if you respond to this. Also, every time I try to enter public lobbies, it ussualy says that they’re full, along with many others having this problem, even when I try to click as fast as possible. Its a pretty big inconvenience and it honestly strays me farther and farther from actually enjoying it. Don’t get me wrong, its an amazing game, just could use some fixes, and I know you took a long time to make this game.

The only reason I am writing this review is to tell people that what they are saying about it is not true and lies. First of all you have to wait ( like 5-20 min ) to get back in a game because you have left a game to much they are trying to prevent you from being one of those people that join a game just to leave. I know that might be frustrating but they are trying to make your experience better so stop complaining it could be much worse. The second thing I would like to address is that all the people are saying “ I barley moved an inch and they said orange vented,” well I am sorry to break it to you people are like that and they are just guessing to try to get you out so don’t complain. The last thing i want to address is people are saying they can’t get into the game because it is full even though it is 1/10. Well think about it there are millions of people trying to get into a game so they pick a game quick. My overall opinion of the game is great because there are no adds, it is just fun, you have weird and colorful skins, you can join publicly or private with your friends, there is democracy, and you get to chat.  ( i understand sometimes the chats can be inappropriate but then just leave the game) I did 4 stars because no game is perfect and there is minor glitching with colors but that’s really it.",The only reason I am writing this review is to tell people that what they are saying about it is not true and lies.,4,True,enjoyability,negative,4

Ok I didn’t use EVERYTHING. I didn’t use endermans because (1) they scare the heck out of me and (2) they could just teleport out of their prison cell and murder me ruthlessly in my sleep.

As u rank up the more stars  u need to complete ONE task it’s not fair. Also I downloaded the game mainly to be able to redecorate the house and once you finish the kitchen you get sent outside to build the garden/ greenhouse. It is the most boring part of the game that takes FOREVER to finish. You can finish a room in 1-3 days of completion. But the outside has taken 6+ days to work on and I finally just gave up because of how many unnecessary tasks you have to complete just to get through one day. Every time u think your finally done with the outside theirs something stupid you have to still do. This game is only fun for a few days after that it’ll just make you want to throw your phone in the garbage. Also the amount of coins you get for each level is unbelievable you should be able to get more the higher you level up but nope they just want you to try to buy their packages.

And then the issue of the glitches, I was simply trying to add hotels to the brown property on the board, and made the mistake of moving the app on the screen just a little, no completely moving or closing the game just a slight shift, and I was completely kicked from the game, making it difficult rejoin the game to end my turn. There are many issues but it’s overall too problematic, I will be seeking Reimbursement.","The game is way too predictable, you can pretty much guess how the dice will land based off of how how much much money you have.",1,True,general,negative,5

The cameras on Polus have glitches all over them so when some walks on camera there is a million copies of them and on some areas, two different camera sections collide and look very weird. The chat, I like that you have the quick chat, but I really don’t like that we still can’t just type. It’s so hard to find what you want to say and by the time you find it, everyone has already voted. Also on the Polus map, the names do disappear, but I kinda like it because you can hide. Another thing on the Polus map, the lava is gone, I see the bubbles still but the actual lava is not there. One last thing, when I am a ghost, I sometimes like to go outside of the map, but I noticed that now there is no wall keeping me from going away too far, can you please bring that wall back?

Minecraft is a one of a kind game with so much potential that it has already given us. More cool ideas can always be added. It has an awesome community, lots of servers and cool mods, and even has cool stuff like Minecon for you to look forward to. Because of COVID19, this year’s Minecon might be cancelled. I really hope not. Anyways, that is off topic to this review. I have so many good experiences playing Minecraft. I can remember worlds that me and my cousins would play in. We would build hotels and make our own parkour courses. We tested out with redefine and command blocks, too. Seriously, games like Fortnite have NOTHING against Minecraft! I’m always gonna be a Minecraft fan. I can’t wait for the new nether update coming! It’s advanced the nether A LOT! It’s just awesome! Plus, Minecraft puts out 2 big awesome updates a year. Seriously, I HIGHLY recommend Minecraft. Not scary, not boring, it’s VERY fun, even if your not a gamer, there is a 99.9% chance you are going to love it!

There also needs to be (this is the feature I want the most) to be a statistics option where you can see how many wins and losses, minutes played etc. and lastly, there should be a clock on the top of the screen, because when you exit this app, maybe to check the time, it disconnects you from the game entirely.

There is so much glitches present in Among Us. The last round I played the impostor was the only one remaining but the round was continuing. The black screen glitch is extremely common and sometimes the lobby glitches into the map and the game is unplayable. Second reason: The game barely updates. Ever since I started playing the game, the biggest update (not including bug fixes) was the chat assist and that is about the only new thing I can name. For a half of a year, practically nothing was added. If you cannot maintain the game properly, then you should sell it to a company that can. Third is the community. Although the developers cannot control this, it still makes the game a bad experience for many players. You may have added what I am about to say already, but if you didn’t, you should add a age restriction. There are a lot of people that play Among Us who are not very smart and accuse people for no reason and everybody listens without any evidence. This makes the game very easy for the impostor because of how gullible the majority of the community is. And even if you are the impostor it still ruins the game because you can execute it perfectly and still get voted out because “Red sus” I have stopped playing the game because it just never added anything new and became very bland.

You see, I was trying to buy a house on States Avenue and with the ‘improvements to the interface’ they’d added, the stupid Buy Houses button completely covered up the property, so good luck putting a house on States Avenue! (or Virginia Avenue, for that matter!) These ‘Improvements’ make it very hard to see what I was doing at times, but make it impossible to do certain things to other times. This makes the game virtually unplayable at times, particularly making certain plays like trading or mortgaging property or buying/selling houses. I’ve been playing this game a lot recently and only noticed this problem today, which means it updated last night for me to enjoy these ‘improvements to the interface’ today.

It keeps kicking me out before I even get a chance to play a game. For instance, I was playing with a bunch of my friends on a call, and right when the game started, it kicked me out and I didn’t get to play. But luckily, I have it on my computer and I still got to play, but not for a couple of rounds. Maybe it’s just my phone, but maybe not. 2. We need friends in the game. Let me explain. If you play like 5 games in a row with someone and you’re bonding with them, maybe you have to go or maybe they have to go, or if you get kicked or something, you never get to see each other ever again. Also it could be the same thing except with friends. And maybe you can see if you’re friends (in the game) are playing. 3. Newer stuff, like new colors, tasks and hats would be absolutely amazing! I have seen that the developers are working on a new map. 1 question about that. Is it gonna be a hide and seek map? If so that would be the most wonderful thing! Or even just another map even if the one you’re working on isn’t a hide and seek one. I love Among Us and all its features. I very much respect everyone that works on it, and I know it’s hard.

I wouldn’t give this game anything below 5 stars! But, there are a lot of things that concern me a little to. First, the over usage of bad words and #. It’s pretty hard to find a game where no one is constantly cussing inappropriate things in the chat, which ruins the game for everyone! On the other hand, there are some ridiculous hashtags marked on a word that isn’t even bad! Some people also put very disgusting things as their names. Another thing I would like to suggest is adding friends! Me and my friend just started playing together yesterday but it was very hard to get her into the same game as I am. Sometimes it’s very boring if we start a new game as host and no one’s joining!

There are 2 that really stick out. The first one starts once you get to about 100k score, but gets more prevalent once you get to about 250k. What it happens is, when you jump from the ramp up onto the train, and land on the train, you stay floating, and it won’t let you jump or roll, once you go to the left or right, it’s fixed though. That doesn’t mean it’s fine though, because if you don’t notice it, it might kill you. The second, and worse of the two comes down to the hit-boxes. This just happened to me right before writing this review. On top of the trains, sometimes you just want to go left or right, but when you try, you stumble into nothing. That just happened to me... two trains in a row and it got me killed. Luckily I had just started the round and it seems to happen in the early stages most often so at least it’s hard to ruin your high score with that glitch, but that one is much more annoying because you can’t avoid it. There are a few others that aren’t as bad, for example, earlier I had super sneakers on and went into a jet pack, paused the game for a bit, then I started running in the air with the jet pack on.

Second, the animations are so annoying!  (Frankly, they were annoying in the old version, too) They are in the way so I can’t see the right side of the board. They are too long and they don’t get shorter when you play a quick game. Third, some of the options in the older version aren’t in the newer one like removing those animations, slight of hand, starting allowance, starting properties, etc.  Fourth, it’s pretty obvious whose turn it is, so I don’t need an obnoxious banner across the screen before every freaking turn!  Finally, the main reason I got this version was because I was hoping the trade AI would get better, but not really. It got slightly better when doing a human to computer trade, but the computer to computer trades are pathetic. It’s like they all gang up to get monopolies so the human can’t get one.

I don’t mind spending the money here and there, but it’s so expensive, it doesn’t even make it worth it. You get 1000 coins for .99 and it takes 900 coins to get 5 extra turns. That adds up really quick! Plus it’s even more expensive if you want power ups! I’m not too sure how much more I can continue playing if they don’t make some changes. It’s beginning to add up with how many coins I’ve been buying just to beat rounds. On top of that I believe that there are also sometimes when the board isn’t applying the power ups correctly.

It’s pretty bad when you start a match with no moves and it has to reshuffle. Power ups can be hit or miss at the start. Towards the higher levels you’ll start off with a very small section and you’ll have to open the rest of the field but you’ll end up wasting 3 or 4 moves before you can even do that. Some levels seem impossible to beat without the RNG gods giving you tons of power ups. You’ll often lose by 1 move which prompts you to use coins to buy 5 more moves. If you don’t have the coins, that’s when they hit you with the pay to win aspect of it. As many other people have said, it often feels like the game is working against you maliciously so you’ll be forced to buy more coins or power ups. It gets extremely frustrating playing the same level thirty times and losing by 1 move over and over. This is the same for both gardenscapes and homescapes (and probably the other games by the same developers). Bottom lines is you can pretty much tell by mid match if you’re going to beat the level or not. If you still have 75% of the objectives to complete and you’ve been forced to waste 3 or 4 moves in a row and you have less than 10 moves left, you’re not gonna win. I usually just quit and start over at that point. No sense continuing if I already know it’s a dead match.",Some levels seem impossible to beat without the RNG gods giving you tons of power ups.,2,True,enjoyability,negative,4

Subway Surfers by Killow is just the app to get.  To start with I like all the powerups.  A powerup is a thing that you can get that can help you get more coins.  I like the jetpack powerup because it gives you lots of coins without the police officer chasing you.  I also like the magnet power up because you can get all the coins for a couple seconds without crashing. I also like how you can get keys.  Keys are things that are hard to get but you can get a lot of stuff with them like outfits and hoverboards.  For example, you can get characters with them.  I also like how you can get keys by doing stuff like getting 810 coins in one run you can get 8 keys.  Last of all, I like how you can watch videos to get things.  For example, you can watch a video every day to get two keys and you can also get super mystery boxes by watching videos too.  Last, I like  if you are at 0 coins or 0 keys, you can watch videos nonstop and get 10 keys in 15 minutes or get 10,000 coins in 20 minutes.  As you can see this is a very good game.

But ever since Character Creator has been added to the game, my custom skins have been looking off. I use slim-armed skins because I prefer them over classic skins but the glitch only occurs on slim-armed skins. Let’s say you have a slim-armed skin, and you wanted a unique design on each leg. Like different-lengthened socks, or a flower on one and a star on the other. Then when you upload the skin on the game, whatever way you designed the right leg (it looks like the left leg if you look straight at the skin) gets copy and pasted automatically onto the left leg (right leg if you look at the skin straight at the face). It looks distorted, as I don’t know if other players can or cannot see the error besides yourself, but it’s basically both legs are symmetrical while a lot of skin designers like not making symmetrical, and the second layer on the leg that gets changed to looking like the other stays. So basically the glitched leg looks exactly like the other leg that looks perfectly fine, but has second layer on it. Like then both legs would have like a flower on it but the star’s second layer is stuck on top of the copy and pasted flower. Pretty odd right? For me it makes me feel like I have OCD, I can’t stand skins that have something off on it, sorry. It doesn’t do the glitch on classic skins though.

As the levels become more difficult even the boosters seem less effective. Where on prior levels you can get a few boosters and they could help you win the level, but later it takes more than triple the amount of boosters to pass the level and they don’t seem to be as powerful. Some levels are almost not passable without spending actual money to buy enough boosters so you can pass it or unless you just get lucky and pieces fall just right. Even when you do complete a puzzle the amount of coins you win doesn’t seem to match up with the difficulty of that puzzle. Only receiving 60 coins for a puzzle it took 20 times to pass.Making it feel almost not worth all the times you had to play to pass the single puzzle.

After playing almost 20 single player matches I found some major flaws. The most annoying being the roll of the dice is not random.

I controlled all property and railroads from the go square to free parking, yes that includes the orange properties!  The opposing side only had boardwalk and park place. We both had hotels on all monopolies owned. For a numbered point of reference that’s 13 out of 20 to one side while the ai had 2 out of 20 on the opposing side. I recorded 12 cycles and I landed 8 out of 12 cycles on either one of his two squares while the ai landed only 9 times on my 13 squares out of the 12 cycles. Almost every cycle I landed on his two properties and yet many times the ai only landed on a chance, just visiting, income tax, or community passing through unscathed on my side of the board. When the ai did land it was a surprise. I’ve played enough games to realize there is some scripting going on.

Ok, you do the math.... when it’s all said and done you have to spend money on extra lives to beat the boards, on coins to advance in the levels and get the stars you need in order to fix things to advance!  As the boards get harder we should get more stars, Hard=2 stars, Super Hard=3 stars and so forth, as we advance in the game tasks cost more stars so we should naturally EARN more stars to off set it!  Not keep us at 1 star per level, but the higher we go tasks are costing us 6-12 stars PER TASK, come on!! Same with the coins! It’s not fair, and you are forcing people to spend money if they want to continue in the game at a reasonable pace. Love the game, hate the setup!

All my games just so happen to go the same way.  At first, because the AI is on easy mode, I to great! I’m usually the first to get monopoly while the AI is rolling decent and realistic rolls. This positive trend follows into the middle game up until the endgame. During the endgame, their is a switch.  With 2 players bankrupt, me having a thousand dollars minimum 2-4 monopolies all with a few houses and hotels. The other player is generally just as good. But, something changes. For some reason the AI just so happens to just the correct numbers to avoid my hotels/2-4 houses...for like 6 rotations to the board... they literally almost never land on my properties when there is only one AI left.  Me in contrary, is landing on every single one of their and gets all the chance cards which make me pay more. The chance cards they land on gives them money no matter what in the endgame. You cannot tell me this game is rigged against the player. Sometimes AI’s came back several thousands of dollars and ended up winning.  The game while fun, is against the human player. If not, explain my experiences. “Which happened consecutively”",This positive trend follows into the middle game up until the endgame.,3,True,general,positive,5

There is so much glitches present in Among Us. The last round I played the impostor was the only one remaining but the round was continuing. The black screen glitch is extremely common and sometimes the lobby glitches into the map and the game is unplayable. Second reason: The game barely updates. Ever since I started playing the game, the biggest update (not including bug fixes) was the chat assist and that is about the only new thing I can name. For a half of a year, practically nothing was added. If you cannot maintain the game properly, then you should sell it to a company that can. Third is the community. Although the developers cannot control this, it still makes the game a bad experience for many players. You may have added what I am about to say already, but if you didn’t, you should add a age restriction. There are a lot of people that play Among Us who are not very smart and accuse people for no reason and everybody listens without any evidence. This makes the game very easy for the impostor because of how gullible the majority of the community is. And even if you are the impostor it still ruins the game because you can execute it perfectly and still get voted out because “Red sus” I have stopped playing the game because it just never added anything new and became very bland.

I love this game! The idea is classic, like mafia but in space. It can be technically called a brain game because the idea of lying and deceiving your “team” is very cool way to stretch your detective skills. Personally, this game is really fun! I wouldn’t give this game anything below 5 stars! But, there are a lot of things that concern me a little to. First, the over usage of bad words and #. It’s pretty hard to find a game where no one is constantly cussing inappropriate things in the chat, which ruins the game for everyone! On the other hand, there are some ridiculous hashtags marked on a word that isn’t even bad! Some people also put very disgusting things as their names. Another thing I would like to suggest is adding friends! Me and my friend just started playing together yesterday but it was very hard to get her into the same game as I am. Sometimes it’s very boring if we start a new game as host and no one’s joining!

It sounds crazy, but I almost wish it was back to the days when you lived off of cows and used boats, but now it’s all cheats and crazy builds and bees. But my favorite part has to be the soundtrack. Listening to these songs, all the memories flow in and rush back, and I think about my brother and cousin building a mansion, and me begging to play, or when my brother would still play with me. This game was my childhood. And while everyone else is crooning over Fortnite, Minecraft remains the best. The music is just magnificent. But, there are a few things that need fixing. Whenever I get on, it says there was an account error, and I don’t even have an account. Also, I made a few characters and they fail to load. Finally, I just wish on Pocket Edition you could go back to different updates so I could play like I used to; no bees, no dolphins, no crazy stuff - just how the game started out.

Just an interesting spin to make the game a little more addictive.  The little side quests like trophy challenges and the parrot gifts are super helpful. However I will say sometimes you are gifted 30 min unlimited game play and you don’t really have an option of when to use it. So if I am getting in a quick game on a break or before dinner and I am gifted one of those it goes to waste if I can’t continue to play for an extra 30 min.  Not going to lie, at those moments It really is frustrating because you get only 5 lives and the regeneration rate is slow. In addition the buy rate for items feels a little high. As an example to buy an extra 5 moves at the end of a tough level is 900 coins. You maybe get 55 coins for beating a level. So you have to tear through 18 levels to earn enough to buy that extension.  It actually de-incentivizes me to buy a package because it never really feels like you are getting a deal.  That being said if you can play and not get frustrated when you get stuck on a level for days, or are willing to pay for buy ups this game rocks.",It actually de-incentivizes me to buy a package because it never really feels like you are getting a deal.,4,True,general,positive,5

But one thing that bugs me is that; After a round an ad plays, right? Sometimes I get an 30 second long unskippable ad. And the game goes on without me and the server gets full. Then it kicks me out and says “This server is full” I know you probably cannot stop this from happening. But I have no one else to talk to so I only have you guys.Update: Oh! And I forgot, sometimes people make servers and people join, only to get kicked or blocked by the host. I don’t understand why people do this. What do they get out of it you ask? Nothing. Can you please make a limit of how many people you can kick? Or perhaps rules I am sincerely sorry if this problem has been fixed. But I haven’t seen it with my own eyes happen to ME, but I’ve seen it happen to others.Update: I’ve now discovered that the “Automatic role” system is very bad for me. I’ve gotten Crewmate almost all of the time. Now it’s rare if I even get imposter ONCE. I try every single day.

It drains the battery so quickly.  It freezes up which forces you to close it and open it again.  The trades the A.I. players make are ridiculous and play after play they repeat over and over even if you silence them for that turn.  Real players wouldn’t do half of this stuff   Sometimes it appears that the dice roll is not random.  Sometimes the chance or community chest cards can be the same thing on back to back draws. Who goes first, second, third is flawed because it depends upon how you are listed and who rolls the highest dice when playing against the A.I players.   Not as much animation is needed which may help the battery drain or at least give an option to turn some of that off. So many things in each turn slow the whole game down and could be altered to keep it moving. Why not put the property cards displaying in the lower right rather than taking up the whole screen.

As I played more and more I noticed some frustrating things. I don’t have to win all the time and make enough mistakes to know why I’ve lost. But the inconsistency on the dice roll for all players is a predictable algorithm with no actual randomness. When I pay $4 I don’t except the world but I would have liked the opportunity to earn thru winning, other boards and pieces. No leaderboard or way to keep stats in this digital world was a surprise.

Ever since the update was released, there is always little no none chatting when discussing who the imposter might be. Also, a way to make this less of a problem is to give people the option to not use the new chat so they could type what they want. This option can give people the chance to communicate better with others. Also, the restrictions on what you can type in the chat like “Admin” can lead to others thinking you were in Admin but that was where the murder was, not where you were. Discussing who the imposter is a pain because you basically have no clue who the imposter might be because no one uses the new chat.

If you own the blue and brown by GO for example, they will often times go to JAIL therefore delaying coming close to those properties.

I get that it’s for safety, but even if I’m not saying anything inappropriate I should still be able to say what I’m saying not butchered.  That’s why I deleted it and downloaded it again so I could change the birthdate I put on it.  Also most of the time after we vote it all goes black and I just hear the sound of people leaving the game so I don’t know if that’s what is happening to other people too and that’s why I hear leaving but none the less it is a glitch that needs to be patched up.  I even waited a bit to see if it would go back to normal but guess what, it didn’t.  Thank you among us for your consideration for younger people by making the safety automated responses, but it’s really not doing it for me.  And please patch the glitch.  I don’t know if it’s because I got a new phone, but I don’t think so because I can hear the sound of people leaving from the game whenever it happens.  Also, when we were voting, I was a ghost and I only saw orange and yellow and I know orange was the imposter since I was dead.  Is this a new thing?  I am so confused since I took my among us break.Plus when I was walking through cams, no one was there, but i saw the cameras have that red light meaning someone is looking.

I know this is good for internet safety etc etc but it’s really annoying. First of all the age limit should not be 18. For those of you who don’t have the game what I mean is that people under 18 have to use the quick chat feature instead of saying whatever. But if you’re over 18 you can use free chat and say whatever you want. I feel that the age limit should be 13 or 14 instead of 18. Like, the majority of this game’s players are under 18 and I don’t think that people over 13 really need that level of “internet safety” protection. Second of all with this new quick chat it takes away some of the things that you want to say about who the imposter is and why you are suspicious of them and whatnot. Some things are so unique you just need to put them in your own words. For example the other day I was playing and I saw Orange running away from a dead body. I reported the body but there was no option to say “(A) was running away from the body.” Some things are so unlikely or one-time happenings that they don’t have options to say it, but when it does happen you can’t do anything about it. That’s why I don’t like this new update and wish that Among Us would go back to the way it was before.",For example the other day I was playing and I saw Orange running away from a dead body.,4,True,enjoyability,negative,4

Just an interesting spin to make the game a little more addictive.  The little side quests like trophy challenges and the parrot gifts are super helpful. However I will say sometimes you are gifted 30 min unlimited game play and you don’t really have an option of when to use it. So if I am getting in a quick game on a break or before dinner and I am gifted one of those it goes to waste if I can’t continue to play for an extra 30 min.  Not going to lie, at those moments It really is frustrating because you get only 5 lives and the regeneration rate is slow. In addition the buy rate for items feels a little high. As an example to buy an extra 5 moves at the end of a tough level is 900 coins. You maybe get 55 coins for beating a level. So you have to tear through 18 levels to earn enough to buy that extension.  It actually de-incentivizes me to buy a package because it never really feels like you are getting a deal.  That being said if you can play and not get frustrated when you get stuck on a level for days, or are willing to pay for buy ups this game rocks.",You maybe get 55 coins for beating a level.,4,True,cost,positive,1

Um not saying they need to be SUPER CHEAP but at least cheaper than you make them ( I would recommend like 10-30k MAX) it’s ridiculous to spend 90k on a character! Also, it take a really long amount of time to get KEYS !!! Like there should be way more ways to get keys. I have been playing this game for over 3 months and got like 80 keys max. I feel that I should of had between like 1,000 at least. Overall it is a entertaining and fun game. I would recommend but just be aware for anyone who plays it it’s hard to get the things you want.

I played MCPE one time for a couple minutes on a friends tablet almost 6 years ago and I’ve been hooked ever since. I’ve then watched java and bedrock YT videos up until the point when I downloaded PE this April. One thing I did miss about bedrock though was that the ambience noises were removed. I’m so happy you re-added them with the nether update. I look forward to more updates like the nether update, although not any that are too massive, because people like me (and there are a lot of us) don’t want to lose the simplicity of Minecraft we grew up with. We all want improvements (bug fixes and Java parity specifically on this version) but we don’t massive changes that make Minecraft unrecognizable. For example, the cave update everyone wants, every one expects a massive change but don’t realize it would completely strip Minecraft if it’s simple mining aspect. I am probably the only person in the world who doesn’t want a cave update, but I just don’t want Minecraft to become something else. I’m sorry this is so long, and I feel bad if any devs actually read this, but I’ve wanted to get this off my chest for a while. Please don’t strip Minecraft’s simplicity from it.

This is fun, too, but you have to be prepared for some disappointment. Currently, there are bugs that prevent games from being finished, and these bugs can happen after you’ve played for 30 minutes or more. For example, if somebody owes money, and they try to make another deal to raise more money, this seems to stop the game. It seems to lose track of whose turn it is (and who is still owed money). Sometimes, if someone refuses all your deals for that turn, it ends your turn for some reason, but the End Turn button is still shown. Pressing End Turn at this point stops the game. If you are low on battery life and get a battery warning, it can disconnect you from the game. Also, players sometimes stop playing, and there’s no warning or way to resign without stopping the game for everyone. In spite of these flaws, it’s a fun game, but there’s room for improvement. Personally, I’m waiting for these issues to get addressed before investing more money in a Season Pass.","This is fun, too, but you have to be prepared for some disappointment.",3,True,enjoyability,positive,4

Something that I find very annoying, is when your in the middle of playing, then get kicked out and it says: “Sent 6 pings” or the “unreliable packet source” or something. Its really annoying how you can be playing and then boom. Back to the main menu you go! So that’s something I would like if you fixed it. And finally, the trolls.

They can send the screenshots to the chat, helping out their case (maybe also a limited amount of screenshots so their not overpowered?). Also the idea of adding friends would be cool! It’s sad you can’t add anyone, and the strangers you could enjoy playing with you’ll only play with once. It would also be nice to adopt mini crew mates whenever their parent dies, I just think that would be very wholesome.

I think the developers have made it way too hard to make any progress that the discouragement way outweighs any fun. Why not give us a way to earn more points (rather than watching commercials about other games—and even that doesn’t get you much)? I almost deleted Gardenscapes last week I was so frustrated. Then decided to try carpet and furniture rather than fountains and flowers. We shall see....,With the Homescapes game I am enjoying a feeling of accomplishment again but I assume that too will soon end.,5,True,enjoyability,positive,4

Would be nice to see the city in 3D more often during gameplay. The “your turn” banner obstructs the dice momentarily. The dice should never be obstructed. When adding houses to the purple properties, the add houses button extends over the purple properties making it difficult to add properties there. I find myself accidentally not buying a property because the buy or not buy buttons are too close together. Maybe a different layout for buying properties. For games against the computer it would be nice to limit the number of times the computer offers a trade. It gets to the point where it is offering trades on every dice roll which slows the game down. For the custom rule set, having an option to start the game with more money would be nice. The EA version of this game had a terrific animation for the game pieces. Would be nice to see the something similar here.",Maybe a different layout for buying properties.,4,True,learnability,positive,6

The bored is still moving, but I’m not getting paid. I’ve tried closing the game and it either lets them redo their move so I don’t get payed, or they stay there and keep going but I still don’t get payed.

I’ve been playing it since I was 8 years old, and it’s come a long way since then. Most games I play I usually play them for about a month or two, three at the most, and then forget about it. But Minecraft is different. It’s stuck with me for a long time now (almost 6 years). It’s a great game to play with friends and family, whether you want to create a massive structure or survive in the wilderness while fighting monsters, or do a bit of both. However, like every game, it does need some improvements. First of all, I suggest that it have a wider variety of animals in the game, (elephants, lions, tigers, sharks, etc). Also, I think their should be more options of furniture, especially in creative mode, rather than having to use steps as chairs. There are also a few glitches that can be annoying. For example, if you add to many mobs in creative, it will lag out your game. Also, there was this one time that I had to delete and reinstall the game because it wouldn’t let me open up the game. Regardless of some minor issues, this game is absolutely phenomenal and highly suggest downloading it! My advice to you is to first read the “how to”, it will tremendously help you get a head start on the game. Once you download this game, you won’t be able to stop playing! Trust me, you won’t regret getting it!!!💕💕","However, like every game, it does need some improvements.",5,True,general,negative,5

However, I would really like to see some better incentives to keep players in the game. For some of the side challenges (e.g. knitting), the rewards, such as unlimited lives for a certain period of time, are given immediately. If I had the option to save that reward for a rainy day, perhaps when I’m tackling a particularly difficult level, I’d be more inclined to play for longer periods of time. When this happens, however, it’s almost always the case that I don’t have the time to actually use said reward and it ends up being useless. I’d also like to see the coin rewards have a better balance. 50-70 coins as a reward for each level won? Come on! What about an additional ten or so coins for each remaining turn? Say if I’ve beaten a level and I have five turns left. I should win the base coins of fifty and then an additional fifty for each turn I didn’t use. For harder levels, base coins of 100 and then an additional fifty coins for each additional remaining turn. Now THAT’S an incentive! That would be rad. Otherwise, fun game!",That would be rad.,4,True,general,positive,5

You can spend hours playing it, HOWEVER... as you increase in levels it starts to become less fun. The boards get harder, naturally, but you still only get 1 star for the Hard and Super Hard boards when you win them. But tasks take upwards of 6 and even more stars to complete. And some tasks are just ridiculous to even warrant a star! Make a call, move an object, can take 2 stars at times!! It makes it extremely hard and tedious to advance in the game. Not to mention the coins, you only get at max about 100 coins depending on what level you beat, but if you want extra moves it 900 coins!!! Ok, you do the math.... when it’s all said and done you have to spend money on extra lives to beat the boards, on coins to advance in the levels and get the stars you need in order to fix things to advance!  As the boards get harder we should get more stars, Hard=2 stars, Super Hard=3 stars and so forth, as we advance in the game tasks cost more stars so we should naturally EARN more stars to off set it!  Not keep us at 1 star per level, but the higher we go tasks are costing us 6-12 stars PER TASK, come on!! Same with the coins!

All my games just so happen to go the same way.  At first, because the AI is on easy mode, I to great! I’m usually the first to get monopoly while the AI is rolling decent and realistic rolls. This positive trend follows into the middle game up until the endgame. During the endgame, their is a switch.  With 2 players bankrupt, me having a thousand dollars minimum 2-4 monopolies all with a few houses and hotels. The other player is generally just as good. But, something changes. For some reason the AI just so happens to just the correct numbers to avoid my hotels/2-4 houses...for like 6 rotations to the board... they literally almost never land on my properties when there is only one AI left.  Me in contrary, is landing on every single one of their and gets all the chance cards which make me pay more. The chance cards they land on gives them money no matter what in the endgame. You cannot tell me this game is rigged against the player. Sometimes AI’s came back several thousands of dollars and ended up winning.  The game while fun, is against the human player. If not, explain my experiences. “Which happened consecutively”","Me in contrary, is landing on every single one of their and gets all the chance cards which make me pay more.",3,True,cost,negative,1

Listening to these songs, all the memories flow in and rush back, and I think about my brother and cousin building a mansion, and me begging to play, or when my brother would still play with me. This game was my childhood. And while everyone else is crooning over Fortnite, Minecraft remains the best. The music is just magnificent. But, there are a few things that need fixing. Whenever I get on, it says there was an account error, and I don’t even have an account. Also, I made a few characters and they fail to load. Finally, I just wish on Pocket Edition you could go back to different updates so I could play like I used to; no bees, no dolphins, no crazy stuff - just how the game started out. For me, listening to the soundtrack and the scent of Winter Candy Apple by Bath and Body Works brings back all the memories. Minecraft will always be with us.

But with the new update I can only use the quick chat thingy which stinks.

I'm on level 454 and have only renovated the butlers room, great room, kitchen, and stairs! Maybe the creators of the game could give players a choice on which room or area to continue with?

Please rework the AI algorithm to make it a more enjoyable and better balanced game!!Reply to developer: I never accused the game of being “rigged.” As any programmer knows, there is no such thing as “random.” Programming any software takes human choice. My point was that the programming of the old version of Monopoly was more balanced than the present version, and as such, the present app needs to be reworked to be better balanced and more enjoyable to play.For version 1.3: the background (city) sounds are much too loud now!

The imposter’s job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with “Confirm Ejects” and “Visual Tasks” on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says “(insert anything here) was not An Imposter” or “was An Imposter”. With it being the imposter’s job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win.

You can spend hours playing it, HOWEVER... as you increase in levels it starts to become less fun. The boards get harder, naturally, but you still only get 1 star for the Hard and Super Hard boards when you win them. But tasks take upwards of 6 and even more stars to complete. And some tasks are just ridiculous to even warrant a star! Make a call, move an object, can take 2 stars at times!! It makes it extremely hard and tedious to advance in the game. Not to mention the coins, you only get at max about 100 coins depending on what level you beat, but if you want extra moves it 900 coins!!! Ok, you do the math.... when it’s all said and done you have to spend money on extra lives to beat the boards, on coins to advance in the levels and get the stars you need in order to fix things to advance!  As the boards get harder we should get more stars, Hard=2 stars, Super Hard=3 stars and so forth, as we advance in the game tasks cost more stars so we should naturally EARN more stars to off set it!  Not keep us at 1 star per level, but the higher we go tasks are costing us 6-12 stars PER TASK, come on!! Same with the coins!

I played it everywhere and I enjoyed it very much. I have seen some harsh reviews on the update  and I see what you were going for when you made the update but seems a little rushed. It also is a little laggy but barely. I’m very confused on how to work the game with so much going on with the new update. I am slowly adapting to it but I really think that you should change it back to the original version. Although I do understand that kids do play and that might be the reason you did it but it’s way to complicated for them. I think you guy wanted to spice things up and I think some people like it but I could be nice if you would change it back to the old version or at least I have a control in the settings to change it to any version you want. I understand what you were doing and I’m giving a four star rating because I love this game update or not it’s just great. Besides the issues of the update it’s amazing. I just want to let everyone know that you shouldn’t be so harsh the creators just wanted to please you and possibly made a few mistakes in our opinion. ❤️,I understand what you were doing and I’m giving a four star rating because I love this game update or not it’s just great.,4,True,enjoyability,positive,4

However I did find more cons than pros. Let’s start off with finding a server. You have three different maps to choose from. You can also choose if you want to play with 1, 2, or 3 imposters. The imposter’s job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with “Confirm Ejects” and “Visual Tasks” on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says “(insert anything here) was not An Imposter” or “was An Imposter”. With it being the imposter’s job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! This game is ruled by immature 12 year olds and when they get accused, they break lose. I am not exaggerating, I have heard the N word, the F word, and so many other ridiculously bad and racist words in this game than I did in the real world.

Minecraft is one of the best games out there at least for me it is. I basically grew up playing it on my xbox 360. Nothing wrong with the gameplay or anything. But I do have one complaint. Now i’m not entirely sure if this a bug or a glitch so it might be nothing but it bothers me. So basically I play on the server: MineVille City. And when i go into one the minigames, that minigame being High-School Roleplay there are problems with my custom skin. So idk if this has to do with the server but this has happened most of the time. I walk around and when i pull up the pause menu my custom skin is replaced with a random skin. And I sometimes see other players with my skin equipped. And idk if my skin is working or not. Even when i do the inventory menu my custom skin is still there. So Mojang, if you see this then please reach out to me. My Minecraft account is a Xbox live account named Endermen21YT. So please if you can, look into this. Now this could totally just be the server or something else so this might not even be happening. I’ve even noticed that this has happened to other ppl before on those servers. And it only happens when I enter the minigame. In the main server my skin’s fine. So anyway yeah that’s all.

I am not rating it based on gameplay, because that would mean that it would be five stars. My  2 star review is because of the community. Now, the reason it’s not 1 Star is because I met some really good people. Like IJevI, they were kind, friendly, and nice. They wouldn’t even kill me if he was the impostor. He would legit kill everyone else and leave me be. So I did the same. But on the other hand, ITS RADIOACTIVE ☢️ X TOXIC X 1,000,000. I’ve seen people being racist, trolls, hackers, cheaters, discord tryhards (people who cheat by letting their friend get killed and their friend tells them who it is), and more. That is absolutely unacceptable. I am not giving up among us, just warning y’all of the murky waters ahead if you get this. Add friend system!!! I want friend system!!! Don’t do so in the next update, and I am telling my friends it’s a bad game, it is sparse in terms of account management (cuz there is no account managements or accounts at all) it has a toxic community, and can have bad connections sometimes. Edit: well, thanks for adding anonymous options! It will help a lot in games. I also appreciate you adding symbols to the wires for those colorblind people. Still, add a friend system.

Can you also maybe make it where you can favorite lobby. Like there can be a button like a heart or something and you can go to like a tab and go to your favorite lobby’s. Do you also think you can it where when you die you can a have an overview of the whole map. But only when you die so it’s fair. Do you also think you can make something called “watch mode” when you can watch other people play games and you can be I there body’s and watch as they play and overview the map.

Now all the ads I see for this game don't make sense.

It gets annoying when I join only to be wearing their skin. Another thing is that the game constantly kicks me out. I’ll be playing and my screen will freeze a lot.

My ONLY complaint, if you play against the AI don’t expect to win. I’ve won once because AI don’t get lucky and this is on EASY AI. You can have an entire side of the board and they will almost always land on a spot that is either safe or really low value. If you own the blue and brown by GO for example, they will often times go to JAIL therefore delaying coming close to those properties. Anytime they land on a CHANCE or COMMUNITY CHEST, they almost always get positive cards. They continuously try to trade you if they need a card so that can be tweaked.

They’re also charging $30 for a season pass that I believe features strictly cosmetics. 🙄 Marmalade, if you want our money at least give us a solid game.

Reason being, how it really makes you wonder about life’s unexplored lore, and a bunch of possibilities that may come across you in the future. I recently beat the ender dragon in the bedrock version, so I decided I wanted to to stay at the credits screen and read it all the way. Which actually happened. The way the credits screen was written out really had me speechless just because of how simply powerful the language makes you imagine about life, and imagining how far you may go.  I never really thought about life that deep before, when I was still very young, but now that a few years have passed, I definitely have developed a drastically deeper understanding for Minecraft. I believe that Minecraft just isn’t a sandbox game where you can let your imagination and creativity raise the bar as high as you want, but I honestly think it’s more than just a game. The credits screen feels like you’re living a dream come true, which I feel like it’s more than just a game. This is why I’ve been sticking with Minecraft ever since the past decade, and would definitely recommend this game to anyone that is into video games. If anyone actually read this all the way until the bottom, thank you for reading. If you just started Minecraft, keep playing, you won’t regret it one bit. 😇","The credits screen feels like you’re living a dream come true, which I feel like it’s more than just a game.",5,True,enjoyability,positive,4

I truly HATE this update! Honestly...why does it look like they saw a 7 year old drawing and said “I LiKe tHaT iDEa a LoT” worst update ever! I loved subway surfers till that update! Let me add...Before the update I had no ads what so ever! But now I get ads after every run! I only keep this game just because my high score is 2.6 million. The game is way choppier than it used to be too! Also before the update kinda a while back Star Jake used to be 30 keys to unlock! I used him all the time! But now you have to get 150 spray cans! The part that’s annoying me the most is after the update...I had to unlock Star Jake AGAIN! All I have to say to the people that had the classic Subway Surfers... Do YOU like this update? It really wasn’t worth updating the game...I was kinda happy about the loading screen though! I will say that! One more thing... I noticed the multiplier challenges...I’m at 23x... but  I was doing challenges...when I noticed...”23/30 is the 30x the max multiplier? That’s also a bad idea if it is! I had a multiplier of 32x before the update.

Second of all, there has been numerous amount of glitches in the past few days. To start off, it will randomly kick you out of a game while you’re  in the middle of one. This really makes me mad and frustrated because of how many times it’s happened. Next, there is a hacker. You will join a game and the screen will be all black and you can free run wherever. Then when you check the chat it has a link telling you random stuff and to vote for trump. This can be really scary for young ones and we should also not bring any thing political into a game that kids are playing for fun. Also, in the text it says it will hack with your WiFi. Which is true, not for me, but people I know. It logs them out of their WiFi and disconnects them where they can or rejoin. I would really recommend to wait to download the app until these bugs have been fixed. Thankfully, they have said that instead of making an “Amomg us #2” they will wait of and be trying to fix these bugs instead. I would wait until around November, as they said that’s when it should be fixed. I also say you should be 12+ to have this game. Yes, I know how ridiculous that sounds but, there are people swearing in the chat, and especially when there is a hacker at the moment.

It’s my “go to” favorite.  I’m somewhere around level 1100 or close to it.  Some levels are hard to the point that it gets ridiculous.  Some of the hard levels are easy or perhaps it’s just luck to win them.  I have spent days on a level and get frustrated and then dont play for a while...but i still really enjoy this game.  You CAN win every level with out a power up.  You DO NOT need to spend any money on this game, patience is a virtue (so they say).  I have spent money and lately I haven’t.  The one thing i do agree with most reviewers on is this... to buy a power up costs wayyy too much money for the amount of coins you receive for passing a level.  To continue a game (at 900 coins) for a move or two costs a fortune considering you really don’t win much.  To buy three hammers costs too much (1900 coins).  I realize they do want you to spend money and i have but even when you spend, it doesn’t give you much in return.  I mostly just wanted to let people know you don’t have to spend money to win this game...and yes, some of the tasks are eye rolling but....its still a fun game.

I personally was over the top crazy for it and loved it, but it’s now dead for many reasons. One reason is hackers and cheaters. More mods are being used and hacking and cheating is getting more popular. Some times, I can’t play one game without a hacker or cheater. Multiple people play together and say who is the imposter and some hackers are being able to kill in the middle of meetings and do visuals as imposter. Another reason is that there are no new maps. Among us said that the new airship would come out in early December 2020, but they delayed it and said early 2021. Everyone thought it would come out in January or February, but it’s March and it still hasn’t come out yet. Another reason is that the new chat update can’t let you talk freely. Now you spend all of  your meeting time searching around for the prewritten text that you want to say. Another reason is the horrible connection. Some times, I have to spend like 20 minutes trying to connect my game. People say it’s my bad wifi, but that’s not true because my wifi works perfectly fine. The last reason is that some people change settings so that either the crew or the imposters have an almost certain win. If you are reading this long review, then I thank you for your time.

It is so addicting and I love playing it with my friends. I would 100% recommend this game. I would give it 5 stars, however there are three things I would love to see added. The first one is a friends system because it would be a lot easier to join a friend’s game if you could just click ‘join game’ like in roblox. A second thing I would love to see added is a currency like coins or maybe something more creative like aliens. Then, players should receive say, 5 aliens or coins if they win as a crew mate and 10 aliens or coins if they win as imposter. Then, I think players should be able to use these coins/aliens to buy hats or outfits. I also think it would be really cool if we could use this currency to buy higher imposter chances because I would love if I could do that. The third and final thing I would love to see added is a report button. This would be good because I have noticed that some people say weird or disturbing things in my games quite often. I know the creators can’t control what people say, but it would be nice if they could be reported for it. Overall, I love among us but I would love to see these three things added. P.S. I heard the developers are working on a game called among us 2 and I think it will include all of these features and I am soooo excited for that!","Then, I think players should be able to use these coins/aliens to buy hats or outfits.",4,True,general,positive,5

But when you have 10 more moves left and you win the level you are lucky to win 58 coins?!?!  And you just better break out your dollars because some levels you will be killing yourselves to win. Like 498 level I am not going to spend anymore money on this game. And the few moves it gives you to play and the purple blocks that has the bugs in them good luck they get much harder in higher up levels. This level it has the regular white blocks that grow but the purple ones you have to kit them 2 to 3 times and they grow back just one to two moves after you remove another side. To get extra coins for more lives or boosters it is a lot of money for what little you get. 900 coins you get 3 this. And 1900 coins you get 3 globes. The lives run out so fast and sometimes my friends send me lives I see them and play one game go back to collect the life because it won’t allow you to have 6 life’s and it is missing. I am in the room right at the stairs I forget what it is called. Looks like another living room to me. The outside green house it felt like it took years to finish the plot line. I wish you could request the boosters but place them where you want them if you want them in the game. Like they would be added to your side menu but not dropped down in the puzzle because it places them and there would be a awesome move but the boosters messed it up and you only can use the boosters there is no other move.,But when you have 10 more moves left and you win the level you are lucky to win 58 coins?!?!,2,True,general,positive,5

I play to earn the keys and coins through the challenges they give.  And will spend an hour of playing. Using all the available means they give to multiply your scores and boost yourself.  And it simply just takes too much gameplay to earn what they are charging for the items in the store.   You want to just charge me $9.99 for the full game and release most boards and outfits to me. Whatever.  I play it enough I would probably pay it.  But don’t give me the run around and nickel and dime me.  You could spend $100 dollars on this game and NOT UNLOCK EVERYTHING.  are you kidding me?     Change the incentive structure and cost of everything ASAP.  Either offer more coins or lower the prices of the items to get.  I bought the double coins feature.  Still takes a week of playing to buy 1 board.  Then you want to talk about keys?

I woke up this morning to play everybody’s favorite board game when I noticed that the interface had changed slightly. Apparently, there were some ‘improvements to the interface’. I didn’t think it was I big deal at first until I hit a brick wall. You see, I was trying to buy a house on States Avenue and with the ‘improvements to the interface’ they’d added, the stupid Buy Houses button completely covered up the property, so good luck putting a house on States Avenue! (or Virginia Avenue, for that matter!) These ‘Improvements’ make it very hard to see what I was doing at times, but make it impossible to do certain things to other times. This makes the game virtually unplayable at times, particularly making certain plays like trading or mortgaging property or buying/selling houses. I’ve been playing this game a lot recently and only noticed this problem today, which means it updated last night for me to enjoy these ‘improvements to the interface’ today.

There is so much glitches present in Among Us. The last round I played the impostor was the only one remaining but the round was continuing. The black screen glitch is extremely common and sometimes the lobby glitches into the map and the game is unplayable. Second reason: The game barely updates. Ever since I started playing the game, the biggest update (not including bug fixes) was the chat assist and that is about the only new thing I can name. For a half of a year, practically nothing was added. If you cannot maintain the game properly, then you should sell it to a company that can. Third is the community. Although the developers cannot control this, it still makes the game a bad experience for many players. You may have added what I am about to say already, but if you didn’t, you should add a age restriction. There are a lot of people that play Among Us who are not very smart and accuse people for no reason and everybody listens without any evidence. This makes the game very easy for the impostor because of how gullible the majority of the community is. And even if you are the impostor it still ruins the game because you can execute it perfectly and still get voted out because “Red sus” I have stopped playing the game because it just never added anything new and became very bland.

(if that wouldn’t have happened then it would be 5. i strongly recommend that you revert the game to its traditional setup and layout. thanks)","not only that, the game is 2x more laggy, the characters glitch while running, and the facebook friends aren’t showing up.",3,True,efficiency,negative,3

Mind you, I had to pay for this app. It’s ridiculous. DONT BUY THIS APP unless they start making changes and improvements to it. Also they do not have any type of communication system so you can’t talk to your opponents. That should be included in the game to communicate with your opponents, negotiate for trades, or just to simply remind your opponents to end the game.

I know this is good for internet safety etc etc but it’s really annoying. First of all the age limit should not be 18. For those of you who don’t have the game what I mean is that people under 18 have to use the quick chat feature instead of saying whatever. But if you’re over 18 you can use free chat and say whatever you want. I feel that the age limit should be 13 or 14 instead of 18. Like, the majority of this game’s players are under 18 and I don’t think that people over 13 really need that level of “internet safety” protection. Second of all with this new quick chat it takes away some of the things that you want to say about who the imposter is and why you are suspicious of them and whatnot. Some things are so unique you just need to put them in your own words. For example the other day I was playing and I saw Orange running away from a dead body. I reported the body but there was no option to say “(A) was running away from the body.” Some things are so unlikely or one-time happenings that they don’t have options to say it, but when it does happen you can’t do anything about it. That’s why I don’t like this new update and wish that Among Us would go back to the way it was before.",But if you’re over 18 you can use free chat and say whatever you want.,4,True,general,positive,5

For example, every task around the house goes from costing one star to two. The rewards aren’t sufficient to the amount of boosts being spent on harder levels. Some levels are so hard and waste so many lives that you have to use boosts just to get through it. There should be more levels that don’t take multiple tries to get through. Some of the tasks that the game makes you do are stupid. The game is trying to get you to use all your stars so you have to play more, which is typical, but with the levels so hard, it’s really just a tactic to get people to spend more money. It’s also takes way too long for the lives to reload. It’s like 25mins per life. I really liked this game at the start but the further I’ve gotten, the less I want to continue playing. Instead of throwing in so many different aspects into the puzzle games so soon, they should have waited and made it harder much later. I’m only in the kitchen and I spend on average 3-5 lives on each level. I try not to use boosters because they are so hard to earn. Paying 900coins to get 5 more moves on one level, when each level earns you roughly 50-70 coins (hard levels earn you 100+) is just sad. In conclusion, this game only remains fun for the first 60 levels then gets frustrating. Pretty much a scheme to get consumers to spend a lot of money.","Instead of throwing in so many different aspects into the puzzle games so soon, they should have waited and made it harder much later.",2,True,security,positive,9

Initially it allowed you to send and ask for gifts on a daily basis. It also allowed you to watch at least a couple short videos daily in exchange for coins. Now there appears to be no way to send friends gifts unless someone shows up in your inbox, and I have no idea how they get there bc I can also find no way to request/ ask for gifts from them anymore. The videos for coins rarely shows up now, too. When you get and use  power ups that can blow the whole screen, you can see how pieces only react to one object when they should have reacted and been removed due to multiples going off close enough to them. If you have single power ups, they explode pieces that do nothing to help complete the level. I will NEVER make a purchase in this game ever again, so I actually thank this game for making me see the light.

Give us a chance to win coins back.   I gave you 4 stars yet I will delete this game because of inability to win without paying big money, but here is a big thought that may help your creators.  Give bonus random coins for no reason or a closing jackpot at the end of each game or Room.  To spend and spend and never win anything back except 50 coins to 100 coins is disheartening.

You can have an entire side of the board and they will almost always land on a spot that is either safe or really low value. If you own the blue and brown by GO for example, they will often times go to JAIL therefore delaying coming close to those properties. Anytime they land on a CHANCE or COMMUNITY CHEST, they almost always get positive cards. They continuously try to trade you if they need a card so that can be tweaked.

It drains the battery so quickly.  It freezes up which forces you to close it and open it again.  The trades the A.I. players make are ridiculous and play after play they repeat over and over even if you silence them for that turn.  Real players wouldn’t do half of this stuff   Sometimes it appears that the dice roll is not random.  Sometimes the chance or community chest cards can be the same thing on back to back draws. Who goes first, second, third is flawed because it depends upon how you are listed and who rolls the highest dice when playing against the A.I players.   Not as much animation is needed which may help the battery drain or at least give an option to turn some of that off. So many things in each turn slow the whole game down and could be altered to keep it moving. Why not put the property cards displaying in the lower right rather than taking up the whole screen.

When I pay $4 I don’t except the world but I would have liked the opportunity to earn thru winning, other boards and pieces. No leaderboard or way to keep stats in this digital world was a surprise. I’m hoping for change as my thoughts seem to be repeated over and over again in the reviews. I’d love to be able to get my friends involved but most would be upset paying for something with some of the missing options.

The zombie just attacks me if I am under it. When you couldn't well screw it I just played for a long time let's say that. A suggestion? The launcher like choosing a mcpe version you like.  Just like java. Also please add the option to remove features and mobs without turning cheats on. Let's say I removed drowned. Cheats don't turn off. If I remove all hostile mobs. Never.

Before I downloaded this app I read all the reviews! Everything everyone said about it is so true, yet you do nothing about it! I think a game should be fun and challenging but not frustrating! There’s not enough moves especially when a square has to be unblocked two or three different times. The levels can be beat but it takes way too long to beat them sometimes.

I really only play it when I absolutely have nothing else to do because I’ll never get to really decorate the house. I thought that was the point of the game.

It’s so fun and the strategy involved makes it more exciting to play. It also gives such a rush of adrenaline. But whilst this game is structured beautifully and an incredible game, I do have a few small tips that I think could make this game better than it already is. First of all, an add friend button. Me and my friends love playing servers together and being able to friend other users could make it easier to game together. Also a microphone feature would be great. Chatting with the other users whilst playing out loud could be really great, because you’d be talking instead of typing through a screen. You’d be able to pick a game with microphone chatting or without, just whatever you prefer personally. Also being to branch out into private chats with people in the server would be really good. That way you could discuss plans with fellow imposters and win in a better and more strategized way. Also you could chat with friends you’re playing with separately. It would add a better feature of strategy and even betrayal to the game. You could even use it for persuasion purposes. Those are a few small but very effective features I think us among us users would love and highly appreciate! Thank you for this amazing game and I hope you take into account these suggestions!",Also you could chat with friends you’re playing with separately.,5,True,enjoyability,positive,4

It’s not my connection nor my internet because I’ve played live games like this a lot and have no issues.

I always have no choice but to quit to menu! It’s very frustrating! You could allow like a 30 second window if a player doesn’t return and play. Also you should add a chat feature even if it’s preprogrammed with emojis or phrases or something it would be more fun if we could communicate.

But recently the game was updated so that anyone under the age of 18 can not type what they want or need to say. I see that they were trying to fix the problem of swearing and online dating but it just wasn’t the right way to fix the problem. The game used to be so enjoyable, and now I probably won’t be playing it again. There are many other ways to fix this problem, but restricting what people can type so that they can’t get their point across is not the way to do it. If this was removed I definitely would give it a 5 star review, but unfortunately this update has ruined the game for me, my friends and my family.EDIT: I won’t be playing the game again I’ve tried to get over the update but I can’t. To be honest you ruined your own game. The bulk of people that play are teens and now we have no freedom. We get all of these restrictions everywhere and you had to add among to that list. I’m very disappointed. If you could lower the age for safe chat from 18 to 13 that would be great. 18 is very unrealistic compared to 13 which is much more reasonable. Also look at all of the reviews your getting. People aren’t happy and your star level is dropping. I’ll let that speak for itself. Just change the game back or tweak the update please.

It is so addicting and I love playing it with my friends. I would 100% recommend this game. I would give it 5 stars, however there are three things I would love to see added. The first one is a friends system because it would be a lot easier to join a friend’s game if you could just click ‘join game’ like in roblox. A second thing I would love to see added is a currency like coins or maybe something more creative like aliens. Then, players should receive say, 5 aliens or coins if they win as a crew mate and 10 aliens or coins if they win as imposter. Then, I think players should be able to use these coins/aliens to buy hats or outfits. I also think it would be really cool if we could use this currency to buy higher imposter chances because I would love if I could do that. The third and final thing I would love to see added is a report button. This would be good because I have noticed that some people say weird or disturbing things in my games quite often. I know the creators can’t control what people say, but it would be nice if they could be reported for it. Overall, I love among us but I would love to see these three things added. P.S.

This game takes the struggle out of someone having to be banker. A game dragging on for 10+hrs and people are always online playing. There were a few kinks with it in the beginning.

It will be someone else’s turn and they just never come out of their turn. I think their should be a time limit once they have handled they business. Otherwise you have to wait until they “end turn” & this creates problems in the game. My games were all lost and needed to be exited after this occurred and all that I worked for or played for was lost. This creates a waste of time.

The animation is lovely, the load times are quick, and, of course, Monopoly is just fun to play. My only quibble is the programming of the computer players. As far as I can tell, the only differences between the easy and hard modes are the likelihood that the computer players will elect not to buy a property or make a bizarre trade. I find that the game is artificially difficult at times because the computer players frequently make unreasonable trades that savvy human players would never make. For example, Dog will make a trade with Penguin that gives Penguin an orange monopoly (at a time when Penguin has tons of money and can immediately build it up to four houses per property). In exchange, Dog got a second red property that Dog can’t do anything with (because I have the third red property). So Dog gives Penguin an almost insurmountable advantage early in the game for no obvious strategic reason. It seems like a minor gripe in the grand scheme of things, but similar scenarios happen fairly often, which makes the game less fun at times.",I’ve been enjoying this game quite a bit.,4,True,enjoyability,positive,4

For example, every task around the house goes from costing one star to two. The rewards aren’t sufficient to the amount of boosts being spent on harder levels. Some levels are so hard and waste so many lives that you have to use boosts just to get through it. There should be more levels that don’t take multiple tries to get through. Some of the tasks that the game makes you do are stupid. The game is trying to get you to use all your stars so you have to play more, which is typical, but with the levels so hard, it’s really just a tactic to get people to spend more money. It’s also takes way too long for the lives to reload. It’s like 25mins per life. I really liked this game at the start but the further I’ve gotten, the less I want to continue playing. Instead of throwing in so many different aspects into the puzzle games so soon, they should have waited and made it harder much later. I’m only in the kitchen and I spend on average 3-5 lives on each level. I try not to use boosters because they are so hard to earn. Paying 900coins to get 5 more moves on one level, when each level earns you roughly 50-70 coins (hard levels earn you 100+) is just sad. In conclusion, this game only remains fun for the first 60 levels then gets frustrating.

However, I would really like to see some better incentives to keep players in the game. For some of the side challenges (e.g. knitting), the rewards, such as unlimited lives for a certain period of time, are given immediately. If I had the option to save that reward for a rainy day, perhaps when I’m tackling a particularly difficult level, I’d be more inclined to play for longer periods of time. When this happens, however, it’s almost always the case that I don’t have the time to actually use said reward and it ends up being useless. I’d also like to see the coin rewards have a better balance. 50-70 coins as a reward for each level won? Come on! What about an additional ten or so coins for each remaining turn? Say if I’ve beaten a level and I have five turns left. I should win the base coins of fifty and then an additional fifty for each turn I didn’t use. For harder levels, base coins of 100 and then an additional fifty coins for each additional remaining turn. Now THAT’S an incentive! That would be rad.

There is so much glitches present in Among Us. The last round I played the impostor was the only one remaining but the round was continuing. The black screen glitch is extremely common and sometimes the lobby glitches into the map and the game is unplayable. Second reason: The game barely updates.

For a half of a year, practically nothing was added. If you cannot maintain the game properly, then you should sell it to a company that can. Third is the community. Although the developers cannot control this, it still makes the game a bad experience for many players. You may have added what I am about to say already, but if you didn’t, you should add a age restriction. There are a lot of people that play Among Us who are not very smart and accuse people for no reason and everybody listens without any evidence. This makes the game very easy for the impostor because of how gullible the majority of the community is. And even if you are the impostor it still ruins the game because you can execute it perfectly and still get voted out because “Red sus” I have stopped playing the game because it just never added anything new and became very bland. And the community adds on to the bad experience.","You may have added what I am about to say already, but if you didn’t, you should add a age restriction.",3,True,safety,negative,8

I also feel really happy that roblox has released a imposter game because now people who don’t have among us can play it if they have roblox! This game is really fun and I know I’ve said this already but it’s so addictive! I love the game I really do and I think it’s a really good game they mean nothing to do with adding or subtracting from the stuff you already have there I do like the colors and I wish there was a bit more options for people who can’t Buy things but I do think it’s a massive catalog already! It takes a lot to download stuff and I’m pretty sure if he would spend a lot of times creating this I’m sorry for the super long review again! I just wish somehow this game wasn’t as addicting because when you think about it you see all the Youtubers who still posting about it and among us is kind of cool down it’s not as popular now it just kind of had a little outburst like a “15 minutes of fame”. I really appreciate this game and I really am happy to have it on my phone especially because now since I have a better phone it will actually work I hope this review helped for anyone who really needed help figuring out what this game is about. Thank you for reading if you did!",This game is really fun and I know I’ve said this already but it’s so addictive!,4,True,enjoyability,positive,4

The game somehow logged me out of my Microsoft account, and i don't remember the email for it. Though the email part is my fault, Why did it sign me out? Since i cant find anything, ill just delete the app.Update: i have gotten the purchase from my previous review, but now it isn't working again. Whenever i buy something, the purchase goes through but i don't get any coins! I will call and Apple store and/or the Microsoft store to ask to fix this. If you have any response or any information before i do that, please tell me developer(s).Before i get to the complaint, i just want to say that this game is very fun. The game looks really cool, even without any texture packs or really anything from the shop. Thats ehat I have a problem with though, or really more my most recent minecoin purchase. I wanted to get a texture pack, Simply Cubed, and it was about $4 worth of minecoins. I bought it, and i accidentally pressed my home button. I went back on, and the game crashed, but that usually happens when i do that. I went back on but i didnt have it. I tried again, and it said that my purchase was free since i already bought it. I didnt have it though. I tried again, but still no. Ill edit if i get it back.","Though the email part is my fault, Why did it sign me out?",1,True,general,negative,5

I’ve been playing cave game, now Minecraft for as long as it’s been out. I remember how you could press g or h and you could “Clone” yourself. The old days of classic. I remember when there was a girl in Minecraft, and the old avatars.. (Notch messed up a bit..) it’s a fun and awesome game. The days of beta were the best. I remember surprise Friday or Friday surprise, but then it stopped. Until an exception- Surprise Saturday. Ah yes. I remember why polar bears were added in the game, and the reason. Jeb’s wife (I think it’s Jeb’s..) liked polar bears, so that’s why they were added. The original Mobil lite version, and I remember when Minecraft PE was free. All this time it’s been downloaded in my cloud storage, so I never had to buy it. (Heh) This game never stops improving. But of course, I’m more of a Java version myself, of course. The days of me and the boys, staying up all night, gaming, building whatever we could. I also remember the day when Microsoft bought Mojang, or did they buy Minecraft? Anyways. The first minecon was about 30 people, mostly Notches’ family. The good ol days of Minecraft. A few things could be changed though. The shooting speed of skeletons is very high, I dislike that, I have some other things, but I don’t want to keep you from doing your jobs. Thanks so much for these amazing 12 years of Minecraft! You guys rock! I can’t wait for the cave update! :)",I can’t wait for the cave update!,5,True,effectiveness,positive,2

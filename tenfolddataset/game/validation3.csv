It felt very unsatisfying to win an online multiplayer game and not receive any sort of prize as a reward. The dissatisfaction alone was able to push me away from wanting to play the game totally. There is a dire need for some form of level-up system, coin transaction, and prizes. I‚Äôd like to believe that this app has not even scratched the surface of it‚Äôs potential to be incredibly fun, and highly social. The only customization is being able to select what you play as before a game and what map you use, but what about having your own profile and being able to search up other people? What about leaderboards to see other friends or leagues that you‚Äôre able to participate in? The menu is so bland, and it is so very clear that a lot more can be added to make it much more engaging and addictive. Personal daily challenges & achievements.

I‚Äôve played many games, but this one has become my favorite. Over time though, I am beginning to get frustrated!

I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs after that, because it‚Äôs just so much! Even with the rewards they grant, you only get 100 coins which is like nothing. You really have to spend money to play this game. I‚Äôve tried to be patient and play the games out without spending money, but many levels you just can‚Äôt! I don‚Äôt mind spending the money here and there, but it‚Äôs so expensive, it doesn‚Äôt even make it worth it. You get 1000 coins for .99 and it takes 900 coins to get 5 extra turns. That adds up really quick! Plus it‚Äôs even more expensive if you want power ups! I‚Äôm not too sure how much more I can continue playing if they don‚Äôt make some changes. It‚Äôs beginning to add up with how many coins I‚Äôve been buying just to beat rounds. On top of that I believe that there are also sometimes when the board isn‚Äôt applying the power ups correctly.

It has changed so much and suddenly blew up out of know where! I have been creating boat racing maps, and almost everything I can imagine. If you can imagine it build it, not only does it show how creative you can be but also make you get more ideas, it‚Äôs almost an addictive cycle. Weird I know I took a break from this game for a year and then boom out of no where blew up.  I would always love to think back to 2011 to when I enjoyed this game on an old pc at my grandparents. Now I can‚Äôt stop playing it. All I can say is thank you, bringing us entertainment for all these years. This game has been there sense the start and came out rough into the best sandbox game I have ever played. Sure there are some negatives about the game, like you can‚Äôt get custom skins off files on Xbox without having to decrepit the games files. I always had used MCPE skin creator/editor and it worked amazingly but sad to know I can only do it on mobile. But put that aside, and you have an overall 90/10 game right now for me it‚Äôs perfect as it is. Sadly the original creators of Minecraft are gone and now bough by another company, if your reading this you might say, the new company is bad.

Minecraft is one of the best games out there at least for me it is. I basically grew up playing it on my xbox 360. Nothing wrong with the gameplay or anything. But I do have one complaint. Now i‚Äôm not entirely sure if this a bug or a glitch so it might be nothing but it bothers me. So basically I play on the server: MineVille City. And when i go into one the minigames, that minigame being High-School Roleplay there are problems with my custom skin. So idk if this has to do with the server but this has happened most of the time. I walk around and when i pull up the pause menu my custom skin is replaced with a random skin. And I sometimes see other players with my skin equipped. And idk if my skin is working or not. Even when i do the inventory menu my custom skin is still there. So Mojang, if you see this then please reach out to me. My Minecraft account is a Xbox live account named Endermen21YT. So please if you can, look into this. Now this could totally just be the server or something else so this might not even be happening. I‚Äôve even noticed that this has happened to other ppl before on those servers. And it only happens when I enter the minigame. In the main server my skin‚Äôs fine. So anyway yeah that‚Äôs all.

It is fun and easy to learn how to play, and it kills time while making us think. I believe the new tournaments are fun, but it needs more. The levels need to make it so more coins can be earned. If I earn the minimum coins per level (50) and play 10 levels, it still isn‚Äôt enough to get a retry on a particularly hard level. Now I do think the fact they are called ‚ÄúHard Levels‚Äù makes it better for us to prepare, and definitely the coin amount there is worth it. But in order to pass a level, I spend almost 6-8 hearts if it‚Äôs extremely time-consuming and hard. There is still the issue with more prizes. I like the daily bonus, but after the seventh day, it sent me right back to the first day without any prizes. I believe it should be after the 7th day, you get all the prizes from day 1-6 at the same time, and then day 8 and on should have more until you reach every seventh day again. It‚Äôs a good way to make people play the game. There also need to be more tournaments that don‚Äôt give prizes based off places. I never get first place in the plane tournament, but in the knitting ball one, I got a lot of prizes and it made me feel more encouraged to try.

Second of all, there has been numerous amount of glitches in the past few days. To start off, it will randomly kick you out of a game while you‚Äôre  in the middle of one. This really makes me mad and frustrated because of how many times it‚Äôs happened. Next, there is a hacker. You will join a game and the screen will be all black and you can free run wherever. Then when you check the chat it has a link telling you random stuff and to vote for trump. This can be really scary for young ones and we should also not bring any thing political into a game that kids are playing for fun. Also, in the text it says it will hack with your WiFi. Which is true, not for me, but people I know. It logs them out of their WiFi and disconnects them where they can or rejoin. I would really recommend to wait to download the app until these bugs have been fixed.

I love all of the updates and in my opinion the new update every one is complaining about is actually really good! But besides all of the amazing stuff my game has been glitching hardcore. So when I spawned into a survival world there was like the unfinished portal thing. Ofc I went to it to loot it and I got a golden pickaxe and sword. When I went to go mine coal it gave me the ore blocks instead of just coal. I didn‚Äôt think much of it until I went to go mine iron and it gave me nothing! This has been happening on every single one of my survival worlds. Maybe because it has Smite 1 on the golden pickaxe but if so why would you give that out to people? I stumbled across a village and went to go see if they had a furnace so I didn‚Äôt have to make one. Halfway through making cooking something in the Blast Furnace it just completely stopped. I tried taking everything out and putting them back in but no. I was really annoyed because I needed to cook food! Since it wasn‚Äôt working I decided to make a regular furnace. Checked the crafting recipe and it wanted a different block than cobble it wanted ‚ÄòBlackstone‚Äô? I didn‚Äôt even know that existed in the game! A lot other glitches have been happening I just can‚Äôt think of all of them right now. Those glitches stood out to me the most.

Although it‚Äôs a very well made very fun to play game, there‚Äôs some things that I think would be cool to add either to among us or among us 2. 1. There should be a way to kick people faster if you‚Äôre the host during a game. Some people like to call emergency meetings and waste time, so being able to kick them out would make it go by way faster. 2. I think it would be awesome to add a send a friend request button. Some people have really good friendships on here and a lot of the time one of them might disconnect or have to go and never see each other again! ;( If we had a add friend button, we could always play with them. Plus, when you try to give your personal number or social media‚Äôs out to someone, the whole server can see it unless you ban them all. 3. I think I saw this on another review, but maybe add a limit to camera time? It‚Äôs kinda hard to kill when people are guarding the cameras. 4. Hackers and exploiters should be automatically banned from playing. Maybe you could install a thing that detects their programming and stuff? They ruin the game a lot.

In multiplayer matches I see a huge disadvantage of playing against players who are really good in playing. Accuracy and shooting of opponents are far tough to survive through especially in domination mode in multiplayer matches.Gameplay must be also set in terms of measuring a players‚Äô aiming, shooting accuracy and shooting speed in order to prevent matches from getting extremely tough.

I believe it should be after the 7th day, you get all the prizes from day 1-6 at the same time, and then day 8 and on should have more until you reach every seventh day again.

I love this game! The idea is classic, like mafia but in space. It can be technically called a brain game because the idea of lying and deceiving your ‚Äúteam‚Äù is very cool way to stretch your detective skills. Personally, this game is really fun! I wouldn‚Äôt give this game anything below 5 stars! But, there are a lot of things that concern me a little to. First, the over usage of bad words and #. It‚Äôs pretty hard to find a game where no one is constantly cussing inappropriate things in the chat, which ruins the game for everyone! On the other hand, there are some ridiculous hashtags marked on a word that isn‚Äôt even bad! Some people also put very disgusting things as their names. Another thing I would like to suggest is adding friends! Me and my friend just started playing together yesterday but it was very hard to get her into the same game as I am. Sometimes it‚Äôs very boring if we start a new game as host and no one‚Äôs joining! I think it would be nice to friend request and then we can request our friends to be able to join the public server we are in! It would save a ton of time. Other than these complaints I absolutely love this app. If you are the creator, please keep doing what you do!","First, the over usage of bad words and #.",5,True,general,negative,5

It is a great game to play with friends and just play in your free time. I love being the imposter and being a crewmate is just as fun. Though, so people have been hacking the game and choosing who the imposter is, walking outside the ship, and sabotaging when they are even not a crewmate. (By the way, crewmates cannot sabotage.) It makes the game a little less fun, but it is still great. Though, recently, they updated it so that in the chat, you cannot say things that you want to say and instead you can only say stuff like ‚ÄúBlah is the imposter!‚Äù or ‚ÄúBlah vented!‚Äù (The imposter can go though vents to travel faster.) It is WAY more confusing than the older version and it makes it a little less enjoyable. When I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to operate the chat to say something, people assumed I was the imposter and voted me out. (You can vote people out if people vote them out.) I know that they did this so that it can be safer so that people don‚Äôt say bad words, but it is difficult. Also, I know that the people who made among us cannot change this, but could you at least put ‚ÄúI am having trouble using the chat,‚Äù or something like that?

The only time something really weird happened was when somebody with a weird name had tried to get us to follow his/her Twitter, but thanks to the new update Among Us blocks your ability to redirect to another website in the chat. Here‚Äôs the thing though. Recently, I ran into another one of the weird-named people, and they said in the chat that the lobby was hacked and he/she had all of the players‚Äô IP addresses. This was an empty threat, as IP addresses are public knowledge (and you can‚Äôt find out where you are based on them)and Apple phones are virtually impossible to hack. However, this really shook me up and I deleted Among Us immediately. I didn‚Äôt want to be hacked. EVER. It was kind of scary even though I knew the extensive anti-hacking measures taken place by InnerSloth (the game‚Äôs creator). While this game is fun, it‚Äôs not worth it being scared every time my friends aren‚Äôt up for a game. If you are getting this for a group of friends/family, then you are fine. But stick with private games, and if InnerSloth can, fix these hackers!!!!","But stick with private games, and if InnerSloth can, fix these hackers!!!",3,True,effectiveness,negative,2

It keeps kicking me out before I even get a chance to play a game. For instance, I was playing with a bunch of my friends on a call, and right when the game started, it kicked me out and I didn‚Äôt get to play. But luckily, I have it on my computer and I still got to play, but not for a couple of rounds. Maybe it‚Äôs just my phone, but maybe not. 2. We need friends in the game. Let me explain. If you play like 5 games in a row with someone and you‚Äôre bonding with them, maybe you have to go or maybe they have to go, or if you get kicked or something, you never get to see each other ever again. Also it could be the same thing except with friends. And maybe you can see if you‚Äôre friends (in the game) are playing. 3. Newer stuff, like new colors, tasks and hats would be absolutely amazing! I have seen that the developers are working on a new map. 1 question about that. Is it gonna be a hide and seek map? If so that would be the most wonderful thing! Or even just another map even if the one you‚Äôre working on isn‚Äôt a hide and seek one. I love Among Us and all its features. I very much respect everyone that works on it, and I know it‚Äôs hard.

So here's what happened: I was playing Subway Surfers for most of the day, during car rides and stuff, whenever I had a little free time. But on this day I just couldn't die. I used over 80 hoverboards, 1 key and amassed over 4000 coins and a wrecking 3 million score. This was done over a accumulated time of two hours. It was awesome. But I had to go to sleep. I left the app open with my phone charging and went to bed. The next morning, I went straight to my phone, unlocked it, and since it was left on Subway Surfers, it went to Subway Surfers.  Here is where I know most people would be incredibly angry; this is a 3-million-2-hour-score, you know? Instead of going to the ""paused"" part, the app RESTARTED!!! I could've thrown my phone, thrown chairs or whatever, but here I am writing a review. I haven't played the app since, and here's additional information: So I also have the game 2048.

Also, can you add a new character: Toon Bot?Toon Bot would be the normal robot body, like tagbot and tankbot,Just a few design changes. For the head, it would be a screen like a TV, changing facial expressions. The TV head would glitch, or bug out whenever the player is caught or damaged. The second costume for Toonbot would be a retro, video game style with a more modern, clean tv instead of an old, 1990 style tv. It would come with a new board witch would simply be a TV remote, special purchasable powers for the board would be zap sideways and super speed. This might add a but of modern-day style to the game.

For a half of a year, practically nothing was added. If you cannot maintain the game properly, then you should sell it to a company that can. Third is the community. Although the developers cannot control this, it still makes the game a bad experience for many players. You may have added what I am about to say already, but if you didn‚Äôt, you should add a age restriction. There are a lot of people that play Among Us who are not very smart and accuse people for no reason and everybody listens without any evidence.

You can spend hours playing it, HOWEVER... as you increase in levels it starts to become less fun.

And some tasks are just ridiculous to even warrant a star! Make a call, move an object, can take 2 stars at times!! It makes it extremely hard and tedious to advance in the game. Not to mention the coins, you only get at max about 100 coins depending on what level you beat, but if you want extra moves it 900 coins!!! Ok, you do the math.... when it‚Äôs all said and done you have to spend money on extra lives to beat the boards, on coins to advance in the levels and get the stars you need in order to fix things to advance!  As the boards get harder we should get more stars, Hard=2 stars, Super Hard=3 stars and so forth, as we advance in the game tasks cost more stars so we should naturally EARN more stars to off set it!  Not keep us at 1 star per level, but the higher we go tasks are costing us 6-12 stars PER TASK, come on!! Same with the coins!

I recently beat the ender dragon in the bedrock version, so I decided I wanted to to stay at the credits screen and read it all the way. Which actually happened. The way the credits screen was written out really had me speechless just because of how simply powerful the language makes you imagine about life, and imagining how far you may go.  I never really thought about life that deep before, when I was still very young, but now that a few years have passed, I definitely have developed a drastically deeper understanding for Minecraft. I believe that Minecraft just isn‚Äôt a sandbox game where you can let your imagination and creativity raise the bar as high as you want, but I honestly think it‚Äôs more than just a game. The credits screen feels like you‚Äôre living a dream come true, which I feel like it‚Äôs more than just a game.

You CAN win every level with out a power up.  You DO NOT need to spend any money on this game, patience is a virtue (so they say).  I have spent money and lately I haven‚Äôt.  The one thing i do agree with most reviewers on is this... to buy a power up costs wayyy too much money for the amount of coins you receive for passing a level.  To continue a game (at 900 coins) for a move or two costs a fortune considering you really don‚Äôt win much.  To buy three hammers costs too much (1900 coins).

With the old game, if I played 20 games, I could strategize and win about half of them. With this new version, I‚Äôve won only once in 20 games! And that‚Äôs only because I refused to trade. The AI consistently ends up with more funds from giveaways and pays less taxes while the human pays more taxes and gets fewer random giveaways. Please rework the AI algorithm to make it a more enjoyable and better balanced game!!Reply to developer: I never accused the game of being ‚Äúrigged.‚Äù As any programmer knows, there is no such thing as ‚Äúrandom.‚Äù Programming any software takes human choice. My point was that the programming of the old version of Monopoly was more balanced than the present version, and as such, the present app needs to be reworked to be better balanced and more enjoyable to play.For version 1.3: the background (city) sounds are much too loud now!

There are a few problems though. To name a few, when you use an ad to revive, sometimes you will respawn you end up in an area where you are supposed to be on top of a train, so all 3 lanes have trains coming at you just to kill you again and the only way to survive is to waste a board so you can crash into a train. Also, parts of the game don‚Äôt make sense. For example, you‚Äôll jump over a barrier and then you‚Äôll see a train going down the same lane where the barrier is just to run over it. Trains will also appear out of nowhere. Keys are another huge problem. They are so rare to find and then if you don‚Äôt want to watch an ad to revive, you have to pay at least one key. As you keep dying, you need more and more keys to the point where the amount needed is insanely high. I also would like to see the game have challenges instead of only being able to run on an endless road.

At least put it in the update details that it won't work on device x,y, and z (I did have automatic updates on, in fairness, but I have disabled auto-updates now). Honestly, I haven't had my device charged for a few days, and when I did, I turned all the graphics down, etc., and it helped. However, it makes the game very hard to enjoy, pretty much impossible for me. Very disappointed. It still does kick me, and the inventory menu stuff seems laggy and slow still.

Another complaint I have is the only games rules we have to choose from are: Classic and Quick mode. It would be nice to have the options to change the rules/play custom games and whatnot.

Sometimes, you need just 2 more moves to pass the level and you can‚Äôt because you‚Äôre out of moves. Then, if you want more, you have to pay 900 coins for only five more moves. And if you don‚Äôt have the money, you have to forfeit and loose the game. Other times, you can join competitions and get really cool power ups.

This game takes the struggle out of someone having to be banker. A game dragging on for 10+hrs and people are always online playing. There were a few kinks with it in the beginning. But I am seeing that they are fixing it now. I am only giving it 4 stars because as of late a lot of the games I have been in the middle of playing will just not be able to resume. It will be someone else‚Äôs turn and they just never come out of their turn. I think their should be a time limit once they have handled they business. Otherwise you have to wait until they ‚Äúend turn‚Äù & this creates problems in the game. My games were all lost and needed to be exited after this occurred and all that I worked for or played for was lost. This creates a waste of time. Which is pretty unfortunate but other than that this game is extremely fun. I purchased both the other boards the snow and the 1930‚Äôs board I love all of them.

I personally was over the top crazy for it and loved it, but it‚Äôs now dead for many reasons. One reason is hackers and cheaters. More mods are being used and hacking and cheating is getting more popular. Some times, I can‚Äôt play one game without a hacker or cheater. Multiple people play together and say who is the imposter and some hackers are being able to kill in the middle of meetings and do visuals as imposter. Another reason is that there are no new maps. Among us said that the new airship would come out in early December 2020, but they delayed it and said early 2021. Everyone thought it would come out in January or February, but it‚Äôs March and it still hasn‚Äôt come out yet. Another reason is that the new chat update can‚Äôt let you talk freely. Now you spend all of  your meeting time searching around for the prewritten text that you want to say. Another reason is the horrible connection. Some times, I have to spend like 20 minutes trying to connect my game. People say it‚Äôs my bad wifi, but that‚Äôs not true because my wifi works perfectly fine. The last reason is that some people change settings so that either the crew or the imposters have an almost certain win. If you are reading this long review, then I thank you for your time.

It happens way too often. 2 when playing multiple computer opponents, if the first computer player on the list of players on the right side of the screen goes bankrupt, you can no longer purpose a deal with the other remaining opponent. It defaults to try to make a trade with the bankrupted player with no option to change it to the other player, so the only way to trade is to wait for the computer to strike a trade with you and then counter the trade. 3 when you get a card that says each player pays $10 for a birthday or whatever, the money never comes out of the players account. Maybe that‚Äôs because of the free parking rule. Not sure. 4 if you use up all of the houses so that there aren‚Äôt any more in reserve, and then sell a hotel, more houses Automatically appear.

There is so much glitches present in Among Us. The last round I played the impostor was the only one remaining but the round was continuing. The black screen glitch is extremely common and sometimes the lobby glitches into the map and the game is unplayable. Second reason: The game barely updates. Ever since I started playing the game, the biggest update (not including bug fixes) was the chat assist and that is about the only new thing I can name. For a half of a year, practically nothing was added. If you cannot maintain the game properly, then you should sell it to a company that can. Third is the community. Although the developers cannot control this, it still makes the game a bad experience for many players. You may have added what I am about to say already, but if you didn‚Äôt, you should add a age restriction. There are a lot of people that play Among Us who are not very smart and accuse people for no reason and everybody listens without any evidence. This makes the game very easy for the impostor because of how gullible the majority of the community is. And even if you are the impostor it still ruins the game because you can execute it perfectly and still get voted out because ‚ÄúRed sus‚Äù I have stopped playing the game because it just never added anything new and became very bland.

That just happened to me... two trains in a row and it got me killed.

Not that they‚Äôre not working extra hard to make you do it... When I started playing, it was fun because I always had a chance to win. The kite will do what it‚Äôs supposed to and the bombs won‚Äôt go and destroy the next move. The rocket with a kite won‚Äôt go and clear the row with already a rocket in it, thus ruining 2 rockets. Decorating wasn‚Äôt as hard either. You didn‚Äôt need a star to make every call and 2 stars for a rehearsal. Around level 900 it started getting frustrating and I stopped for a while. A few months ago I started playing and nothing is the same. The power ups are there to ruin your game. One has to depend on luck than tact to win. It‚Äôs now designed to eat all your hammers, kites, gloves etc but still won‚Äôt let you win. If I was frustrated before, I‚Äôm finding it hard to express myself now. Ofcourse the proportion of coins you win to the stars you earn was always unfair but atleast I knew that in every game there would be some move and a definite chance to win. They want you to buy coins, I get it, they are after all here for the money. But looks like they‚Äôre taking away the fun factor away from the game which for me has been the biggest disappointment.

The days of me and the boys, staying up all night, gaming, building whatever we could. I also remember the day when Microsoft bought Mojang, or did they buy Minecraft? Anyways. The first minecon was about 30 people, mostly Notches‚Äô family. The good ol days of Minecraft. A few things could be changed though.

There is one thing that I loved about the old one that this new one doesn‚Äôt have and that‚Äôs is: while you are playing you could look and see how much % chance this certain lot would be landed on and by whom. For example, when I‚Äôm trying to build a house I‚Äôd look and see if the cat coming down the road would land on either Baltic Ave or Boardwalk, and the one with the greater % I‚Äôd build the house on.

Then you spend astronomical amounts of money to buy the goodies that help you win each level to have them nickel and dime you by making sure at the very last, when you should be able to pick a move that has ALWAYS, with no exception, removed x amount of things in certain patterns or directions, it only works partially. So, guess what? You guessed it! When you have already spent gratuitous amounts of money to win something, that never in a million years makes you feel like you won anything, you have to spend more. My moral to this story is, as much as I like the whole concept of the game, I get so angry and frustrated at their trickery(aka:dishonesty) with their power plays and how they usually work compared to what happens at the end and how the reward system works that I have decided to find a game that I have no problem spending money on but walk away feeling happy and relaxed about how I spent my very little free time that I have and my money that I work very hard d for.","I love the whole concept of the game, the feeling of accomplishment and pride, lol, as if it were MY home.",3,True,enjoyability,positive,4

Some people like to call emergency meetings and waste time, so being able to kick them out would make it go by way faster. 2. I think it would be awesome to add a send a friend request button.

When this happens, however, it‚Äôs almost always the case that I don‚Äôt have the time to actually use said reward and it ends up being useless. I‚Äôd also like to see the coin rewards have a better balance. 50-70 coins as a reward for each level won? Come on! What about an additional ten or so coins for each remaining turn? Say if I‚Äôve beaten a level and I have five turns left. I should win the base coins of fifty and then an additional fifty for each turn I didn‚Äôt use.

Minecraft is one of the best games out there at least for me it is. I basically grew up playing it on my xbox 360. Nothing wrong with the gameplay or anything. But I do have one complaint. Now i‚Äôm not entirely sure if this a bug or a glitch so it might be nothing but it bothers me. So basically I play on the server: MineVille City. And when i go into one the minigames, that minigame being High-School Roleplay there are problems with my custom skin. So idk if this has to do with the server but this has happened most of the time. I walk around and when i pull up the pause menu my custom skin is replaced with a random skin. And I sometimes see other players with my skin equipped. And idk if my skin is working or not. Even when i do the inventory menu my custom skin is still there. So Mojang, if you see this then please reach out to me. My Minecraft account is a Xbox live account named Endermen21YT. So please if you can, look into this. Now this could totally just be the server or something else so this might not even be happening. I‚Äôve even noticed that this has happened to other ppl before on those servers. And it only happens when I enter the minigame. In the main server my skin‚Äôs fine. So anyway yeah that‚Äôs all.

But even though they have been add new updates to Minecraft I feel they haven‚Äôt been adding things that really would make Minecraft wayyyyyyy better. I love the dolphins and turtles but couldn‚Äôt they add a few more like perhaps turkey or peacocks. I know you can easily get mods for these things but some cost money. I also think that they should add more dog breeds if there weren‚Äôt just a wolf I would have a lot more dogs. Like maybe they could have huskies pugs Pomeranians Shibas Chiwawas and Great Danes these are all great dog breeds. They could have which dog you get by the color of the wolf you tame like huskies would be white wolfs and Great Danes could be brown wolfs. I think you should also be able to tame polar bears turtles and dolphins and after you tame them you can saddle them and ride them. I also think that fish bowls should be a thing because if you catch a fish than you can put it in a fish bowl and depending on the amount of glass you use you get a different sized fish bowl.

For a relatively simple game, it creates surprising amounts of tension, and with the right group of players, the experience can be a total blast. So, why the mediocre rating? Innersloth recently released what I can only describe as a ruinous, game-breaking update. Firstly, disconnections are frequent; in a game whose structure relies upon every player living long enough to cast out the killer(s) before meeting either win/loss condition, losing those players to disconnection means one less pair of hands for tasks, one less vote per meeting, one less identity to hide among, or one less partner to kill crewmates. If it were just one, a person could grouse and learn to get over it. But it is many. The problem is large enough to merit redress. And there are game-ending graphical errors, too. From time to time, avatars glitch through/into walls, or walk into out-of-bounds areas. I even lost a game once where I thought I broke another player‚Äôs alibi because she claimed to be someplace, but she was plainly visible right next to me. Turns out she wasn‚Äôt a liar‚Äîmy game was just glitchy. Post-game glitches often mean rebooting and losing your lobby, which is the end of the world, but can be really demoralizing when you finally find a cool group to play with.

Board games in reality are fixed in many ways. For example, a deck of cards with a discard pile ensured that every card in the game will be played before a player can draw a second copy of any card. This also ensures equal odds of getting a card. This app takes the simpler approach of randomly generating the card on each draw. This means you may draw cards like ‚ÄúSpeeding Fine‚Äù two or three times in a row, while never pulling ‚ÄúAdvance To...‚Äù cards of any kind. The odds of card drawing seem to also favor the weaker cards. The developers assure that‚Äôs not true, but an easy way to restore faith would be to have the cards work with an actual deck and discard system instead of random generation upon each draw. To me, the purpose of this is to mimic the board game, if you wanted to change the fundamentals of the game then a different game mode would be nice. A ‚ÄúRandomized‚Äù mode could be fun along with the original two, but I would want the ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù mode to run like the classic board game. Otherwise, the game is functionally okay.

Then I landed on chance and received the same card as the first guy ‚ÄúAdvance token to Boardwalk‚Äù. Now when I was a young boy I was told you‚Äôre supposed to put your card in another pile and shuffle them when they are all used up. Or you can keep them in rotation and place the card at the bottom.

This is fun, too, but you have to be prepared for some disappointment. Currently, there are bugs that prevent games from being finished, and these bugs can happen after you‚Äôve played for 30 minutes or more. For example, if somebody owes money, and they try to make another deal to raise more money, this seems to stop the game. It seems to lose track of whose turn it is (and who is still owed money). Sometimes, if someone refuses all your deals for that turn, it ends your turn for some reason, but the End Turn button is still shown. Pressing End Turn at this point stops the game. If you are low on battery life and get a battery warning, it can disconnect you from the game. Also, players sometimes stop playing, and there‚Äôs no warning or way to resign without stopping the game for everyone. In spite of these flaws, it‚Äôs a fun game, but there‚Äôs room for improvement. Personally, I‚Äôm waiting for these issues to get addressed before investing more money in a Season Pass.","If you are low on battery life and get a battery warning, it can disconnect you from the game.",3,True,reliability,negative,7

The chances for triple doubles are extremely high when you put it against the odds from doing some simple math. After the building phase, everybody just goes to jail most of the time. It‚Äôs almost impossible to play with conventional Monopoly techniques because of the rigged chances of the dice, and having to deal with random obnoxious bots online, even if you chose to play with real people. This game has too many bugs and too few features. Online Multiplayer never works, they‚Äôve got tons of bots and it always freezes, forcing all players to force quit the game. The animation is also way too long and it‚Äôs been frustratingly improbable trying to play with others online. And the fact that the game is server-sided does not change the developers‚Äô minds to at least rent a competent server, because from what I‚Äôve witnessed throughout the last few months, the servers have been utter trash.

I like how you can put different types of explosives together or two of the same to make a bigger explosive. It would be even greater if you could put more than two together. I've had three explosives lined together but I can't mix all three together. I haven't had 4 or more alined but that would be more awesome. With Gardenscapes it seems like I'm not able to complete and able to upgrade or rebuild anything as quickly as I seem to be able to with Homescapes.

Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone‚Äôs been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful.

Second of all, there has been numerous amount of glitches in the past few days. To start off, it will randomly kick you out of a game while you‚Äôre  in the middle of one. This really makes me mad and frustrated because of how many times it‚Äôs happened. Next, there is a hacker. You will join a game and the screen will be all black and you can free run wherever. Then when you check the chat it has a link telling you random stuff and to vote for trump. This can be really scary for young ones and we should also not bring any thing political into a game that kids are playing for fun. Also, in the text it says it will hack with your WiFi. Which is true, not for me, but people I know. It logs them out of their WiFi and disconnects them where they can or rejoin. I would really recommend to wait to download the app until these bugs have been fixed. Thankfully, they have said that instead of making an ‚ÄúAmomg us #2‚Äù they will wait of and be trying to fix these bugs instead. I would wait until around November, as they said that‚Äôs when it should be fixed. I also say you should be 12+ to have this game.

I‚Äôve been playing it since I was 8 years old, and it‚Äôs come a long way since then. Most games I play I usually play them for about a month or two, three at the most, and then forget about it. But Minecraft is different. It‚Äôs stuck with me for a long time now (almost 6 years). It‚Äôs a great game to play with friends and family, whether you want to create a massive structure or survive in the wilderness while fighting monsters, or do a bit of both. However, like every game, it does need some improvements. First of all, I suggest that it have a wider variety of animals in the game, (elephants, lions, tigers, sharks, etc). Also, I think their should be more options of furniture, especially in creative mode, rather than having to use steps as chairs. There are also a few glitches that can be annoying. For example, if you add to many mobs in creative, it will lag out your game. Also, there was this one time that I had to delete and reinstall the game because it wouldn‚Äôt let me open up the game. Regardless of some minor issues, this game is absolutely phenomenal and highly suggest downloading it! My advice to you is to first read the ‚Äúhow to‚Äù, it will tremendously help you get a head start on the game. Once you download this game, you won‚Äôt be able to stop playing!

I was super confused, so I went into the me section where my boards and characters are to see if I still had my Christmas people, but I accidentally bought a character. And I also had the Christmas people too. After being way too confused I got out for the day. Then, this morning i went on to get my daily snowflakes and words and it wouldn‚Äôt let me watch an ad when I died. I had to use keys. Now, I still had 30-something, but if I continued like that, with the amount of time I spend on the game, those keys would be gone super soon.

The game is fun and requires lots of skill or just fast fingers. My only problems are the prices of some of the items. For the characters I think they can get a little bit pricey. When you get a mystery box it can give you items that help you unlock characters. I honestly think that it might take a month or almost a year to reach the amount because I‚Äôm not joking, they are really pricey. Unless you playing it nonstop without taking your eyes off the screen then it might take a few weeks. But that‚Äôs still a while. Also the hover boards. They can also get a little pricey. And why buy something that you can only use in certain times. It makes it worse that they can get really expensive. Honestly I think their pretty cool but please lower the prices. The last thing you might need to fix is the add lag. Sometimes it will start freezing up and you have to restart the app and that‚Äôs a little annoying in my opinion. I also think that you should only have to face adds if your getting something for free. Other than those issues I truly love the game!

The only time something really weird happened was when somebody with a weird name had tried to get us to follow his/her Twitter, but thanks to the new update Among Us blocks your ability to redirect to another website in the chat. Here‚Äôs the thing though. Recently, I ran into another one of the weird-named people, and they said in the chat that the lobby was hacked and he/she had all of the players‚Äô IP addresses. This was an empty threat, as IP addresses are public knowledge (and you can‚Äôt find out where you are based on them)and Apple phones are virtually impossible to hack. However, this really shook me up and I deleted Among Us immediately. I didn‚Äôt want to be hacked. EVER.

The animation is lovely, the load times are quick, and, of course, Monopoly is just fun to play. My only quibble is the programming of the computer players. As far as I can tell, the only differences between the easy and hard modes are the likelihood that the computer players will elect not to buy a property or make a bizarre trade. I find that the game is artificially difficult at times because the computer players frequently make unreasonable trades that savvy human players would never make. For example, Dog will make a trade with Penguin that gives Penguin an orange monopoly (at a time when Penguin has tons of money and can immediately build it up to four houses per property). In exchange, Dog got a second red property that Dog can‚Äôt do anything with (because I have the third red property). So Dog gives Penguin an almost insurmountable advantage early in the game for no obvious strategic reason. It seems like a minor gripe in the grand scheme of things, but similar scenarios happen fairly often, which makes the game less fun at times.","In exchange, Dog got a second red property that Dog can‚Äôt do anything with (because I have the third red property).",4,True,efficiency,positive,3

Also, since it won't let me re download my decks, we've just been playing the free rounds, and more than a couple times I've sat through the ad, and then the app dies.

This is fun, too, but you have to be prepared for some disappointment. Currently, there are bugs that prevent games from being finished, and these bugs can happen after you‚Äôve played for 30 minutes or more. For example, if somebody owes money, and they try to make another deal to raise more money, this seems to stop the game. It seems to lose track of whose turn it is (and who is still owed money). Sometimes, if someone refuses all your deals for that turn, it ends your turn for some reason, but the End Turn button is still shown. Pressing End Turn at this point stops the game. If you are low on battery life and get a battery warning, it can disconnect you from the game. Also, players sometimes stop playing, and there‚Äôs no warning or way to resign without stopping the game for everyone. In spite of these flaws, it‚Äôs a fun game, but there‚Äôs room for improvement. Personally, I‚Äôm waiting for these issues to get addressed before investing more money in a Season Pass.","Also, players sometimes stop playing, and there‚Äôs no warning or way to resign without stopping the game for everyone.",3,True,cost,negative,1

When you are paying someone money it will do the transfer animation with the monopoly dollars but it will do the same animation no matter how much money was given/lost. The dice. I am slightly annoyed when they land on a flat surface when it should be landing on top of the buildings. It would be cool if the dice Didn't land on the buildings as if they were drawn onto the board. If they landed on top of the buildings that would be cool.

I personally was over the top crazy for it and loved it, but it‚Äôs now dead for many reasons. One reason is hackers and cheaters. More mods are being used and hacking and cheating is getting more popular. Some times, I can‚Äôt play one game without a hacker or cheater. Multiple people play together and say who is the imposter and some hackers are being able to kill in the middle of meetings and do visuals as imposter. Another reason is that there are no new maps.

Some times, I have to spend like 20 minutes trying to connect my game. People say it‚Äôs my bad wifi, but that‚Äôs not true because my wifi works perfectly fine.

It‚Äôs pretty bad when you start a match with no moves and it has to reshuffle. Power ups can be hit or miss at the start. Towards the higher levels you‚Äôll start off with a very small section and you‚Äôll have to open the rest of the field but you‚Äôll end up wasting 3 or 4 moves before you can even do that. Some levels seem impossible to beat without the RNG gods giving you tons of power ups. You‚Äôll often lose by 1 move which prompts you to use coins to buy 5 more moves. If you don‚Äôt have the coins, that‚Äôs when they hit you with the pay to win aspect of it. As many other people have said, it often feels like the game is working against you maliciously so you‚Äôll be forced to buy more coins or power ups. It gets extremely frustrating playing the same level thirty times and losing by 1 move over and over. This is the same for both gardenscapes and homescapes (and probably the other games by the same developers). Bottom lines is you can pretty much tell by mid match if you‚Äôre going to beat the level or not.

This new version is nowhere near as fun to play. Sure, it looks better, and there are more ways for you guys to make more $$ from it, but the new AI algorithm is simply a drag to play. With the old game, if I played 20 games, I could strategize and win about half of them. With this new version, I‚Äôve won only once in 20 games! And that‚Äôs only because I refused to trade. The AI consistently ends up with more funds from giveaways and pays less taxes while the human pays more taxes and gets fewer random giveaways. Please rework the AI algorithm to make it a more enjoyable and better balanced game!!Reply to developer: I never accused the game of being ‚Äúrigged.‚Äù As any programmer knows, there is no such thing as ‚Äúrandom.‚Äù Programming any software takes human choice. My point was that the programming of the old version of Monopoly was more balanced than the present version, and as such, the present app needs to be reworked to be better balanced and more enjoyable to play.For version 1.3: the background (city) sounds are much too loud now!

Other than that I think the gameplay is the strongest aspect of this game as it preys on our natural suspicions of others and that‚Äôs an amazing concept for strangers and friends to play.

I understand the rare server issue here and there but when it takes over 20 minutes to search for game I feel like I‚Äôm literally wasting time.

When you join ‚ÄúOnline Multiplayer‚Äù, and you‚Äôre playing, you can leave the app and come back however long later, and the game would continue from where you left off. This is the first evidence of AI in an online supposed real person mode. The second bit of evidence is that the AI trades at very specific rates: when you‚Äôre paying cash for a property, they want double the property price. If you offer too much lower than double, they‚Äôll permanently reject the offer. Closer to double, and they‚Äôll counter for double. Third bit of evidence is when they offer you a trade, and you decline. If they offered money, they‚Äôll make another offer increasing their offer by 10$. Decline again, they‚Äôll increase by 10$ again. And so on. Another issue is that on Multiplayer with friends, if you accidentally leave the app, you‚Äôre instantly replaced with an AI and there‚Äôs no way for you to rejoin.

Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone‚Äôs been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful.

They are too long and they don‚Äôt get shorter when you play a quick game.

Finally, the main reason I got this version was because I was hoping the trade AI would get better, but not really.

They're pop-up, not videos, so they don't disrupt your game. However, like all games, this one has some problems. My biggest issue is the top run. Every week, the contestants get harder to beat, and eventually you can't get past the last person in the silver because they have over a million. Also, if you get a really good medal, like the diamond, you don't get to keep it for the next week because it changes depending on where you are that week. Another problem is the keys. To revive yourself, you have to pay more and more each time, until it gets so expensive that you can't even afford it. The only way to get keys is in the run, in mystery boxes, or in awards, which is a huge problem because: you only find a key in a run about every eighteen games or so, and if you miss it, then you don't have a chance to get another one. It is extremely rare to get a key in a mystery box, and when you do, it's only one, which can't even begin to pay for the expenses of reviving yourself. It takes a long time to earn a reward, which only gives you three keys, five if you're lucky. So overall, this game is pretty good, but it could use some improvements.",Another problem is the keys.,4,True,safety,negative,8

I have a few suggestions for things you could add or fix. My first thing and biggest thing is a friends list because sometimes when your playing you meet this awesome person but then one of you have to go and you will never see that person that you bonded with again. Another thing is new colors, hats, and pets. I think there should be a wider variety of colors including gray, dark red, light purple, and a tie color could be awesome! There should be additional hats added as well like a set of head phones, glasses, new wigs, and a set of pretty wings. I also think that there should be more pets and pets that you don‚Äôt have to pay for or like watch a certain amount of adds to unlock this pet or do this to unlock this pet. I think they should add a poddle pet, cat, and a bird would be cool. Something that kinda bothers me is that Mirah HQ (probably spelled wrong) doesn‚Äôt have cameras in it. I have also encountered some people who have asked sexual questions and wanted to do sexual activity I know that you can‚Äôt really do anything about that but I wanted to put that out there.

Now I think this could be a good idea, but I have to disagree. You see I think this will discourage players to use the regular typing chat we already have, and for players that A. aren‚Äôt allowed to talk to strangers. And B. Don‚Äôt have a mic, or just are in a crowded room, would not be able to experience the game! Because if they couldn‚Äôt use the voice chat they wouldn‚Äôt be able to hear or talk because everyone would be using the voice chat, the regular chat would be obsolete. And that would make those people stop playing among us! Which would not be very helpful to your company. Also I have read about the hide and seek mode, and really think that should be added along with other modes; because the game as is, gets boring after a month or so. Personally I haven‚Äôt played this game in months because of the lack of variety, I also think a friend system is the #1 thing you need right now because when players who have bonded over a few games are lost to each other forever when they quit/disconnect. All in all it is a very good game with neat gameplay, I just think you need to think about your future because even a game this fun can die fast.

The small mini games shown in the ads are the best part but they are way too few and far between.

If I‚Äôm getting a gift it should be just. There is some humor and the scenes are colorful which is why i gave it two stars. Had the earning of coins been much higher, the mini games much more prevalent, the bank either free to obtain or at least an option, the limiting of one star per repair and not having to use stars on anything other than repairs I could have seen playing this longer.

Now let‚Äôs talk about cheating... now sometimes there is people who are on discord with each other or at each other houses or something like that but every time that I get Imposter then they know that it‚Äôs me most of the time because if there on discord or something like that then they can tell each other if they are a Crew mate or an Imposter and if i‚Äôm the Imposter and they tell each other what they are over discord or something like that then they know that it‚Äôs me because they know what each other are and they are like ‚Äúwell if we are all Crew Mate the he has to be and Imposter‚Äù and that is an easy win for them especially easy if we have 4 or less people in the game... but other then that I really have no other complaints... like overall it‚Äôs a pretty good game and I love the new update and stuff like that sooooooo yeah.",But there are a few problems though.,4,True,general,negative,5

We should be able to make the settings of a game to be microphone only because honestly it‚Äôs easier and takes less time to talk. Number three hide and seek game mode.

I‚Äôve been playing it since I was 8 years old, and it‚Äôs come a long way since then. Most games I play I usually play them for about a month or two, three at the most, and then forget about it. But Minecraft is different. It‚Äôs stuck with me for a long time now (almost 6 years). It‚Äôs a great game to play with friends and family, whether you want to create a massive structure or survive in the wilderness while fighting monsters, or do a bit of both. However, like every game, it does need some improvements. First of all, I suggest that it have a wider variety of animals in the game, (elephants, lions, tigers, sharks, etc). Also, I think their should be more options of furniture, especially in creative mode, rather than having to use steps as chairs. There are also a few glitches that can be annoying. For example, if you add to many mobs in creative, it will lag out your game. Also, there was this one time that I had to delete and reinstall the game because it wouldn‚Äôt let me open up the game. Regardless of some minor issues, this game is absolutely phenomenal and highly suggest downloading it! My advice to you is to first read the ‚Äúhow to‚Äù, it will tremendously help you get a head start on the game. Once you download this game, you won‚Äôt be able to stop playing!

It is really hard to play the game with a chat limit. I do like that there isn‚Äôt anymore swearing because I was getting tired of that, but if there was a wider selection and easier ways to find things, that would be great!! I know this was for a good reason and it was meant to make things easier, but it really doesn‚Äôt. Maybe if you let people type in some things but not everything like ‚Äòyou are an idiot!‚Äô that would be double awesome!! I actually really dislike the chat and now that I think about it you should just take out the new chat feature that you put in. Also, since the update happened there have been SOOOOOO many glitches and I can almost never rejoin a game because it turns black and I have to swipe out and then join a new game every time. I will still play this game because I really love the idea of it though!! Just one more thing... if there could be more play modes like hide and seek which I know lots of people have been requesting, and if there could be a wider variety of positions, because on some peoples channels they have detective and snitch and jester and it just seems like a lot of fun!!

The levels are hard, but they want you to continuously spend money on coins etc.. to try to win or put in an ad about other versions of this game.  It gets frustrating and you want to put the game down and never return.  Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre rewarded with an hour or more of free play,  it ticks down from that minute instead of letting you go in and play on your own schedule and let it tick down.  Some of us work for a living and may play during our lunch or break, if you activate the free time, it is ticking down and over when you are off work and can play.  The creators want you to acquire other versions/themes of the game.. if they‚Äôre like this one.. no way I‚Äôd get them.  Funny that in the garden today while sweeping the butler says how he like to keep the dust out of the carpets there and keeps a clean house ( same thing he says in the house.. you should change the text to match the scenes)  the guitar is in the house, but it magically appeared for him to sit on a bench and play it while chastising me about how hard the game must be for me to play.  when you lose each life, the look on characters face is like you‚Äôre a failure... this doesn‚Äôt encourage you to play, you want to avoid that look like the plague.

Just an interesting spin to make the game a little more addictive.  The little side quests like trophy challenges and the parrot gifts are super helpful. However I will say sometimes you are gifted 30 min unlimited game play and you don‚Äôt really have an option of when to use it. So if I am getting in a quick game on a break or before dinner and I am gifted one of those it goes to waste if I can‚Äôt continue to play for an extra 30 min.  Not going to lie, at those moments It really is frustrating because you get only 5 lives and the regeneration rate is slow. In addition the buy rate for items feels a little high. As an example to buy an extra 5 moves at the end of a tough level is 900 coins. You maybe get 55 coins for beating a level. So you have to tear through 18 levels to earn enough to buy that extension.  It actually de-incentivizes me to buy a package because it never really feels like you are getting a deal.  That being said if you can play and not get frustrated when you get stuck on a level for days, or are willing to pay for buy ups this game rocks.",The little side quests like trophy challenges and the parrot gifts are super helpful.,4,True,general,positive,5

Each update is better then the last, adding amazing animals and new objects. However I have noticed in the recent update, TONS of new bugs and issues have occurred. Such as, sometimes when I am crafting something, I craft it and then go back in the crafting table. But my item is still there. I try to remove it, but it just replaces itself with another one. I end having to close the app and reopen it. Another problem that has recently developed is, whenever I go into chat when I am on a sever, my game immediately freezes, then crashes and knocks me out of the app. Another thing that has recently happened is when I am playing and go into my inventory, it freezes and won‚Äôt unfreeze. One more is, sometimes when I go into the nether, it stays frozen on the ‚Äúloading terrain‚Äù screen. Other than these glitches and bugs, I HIGHLY recommend this game.

But the graphics, the colors, the sequence, the theme, all of it all together is really cute/entertaining for me personally. And I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to delete it, so I continued to play and basically to accept the challenge for what it is. I can say that I really enjoy the changes that are taking place with the app. There are more opportunities to win free lives, and to win free stuff as I am a big supporter of apps that you can play and have fun with without having to shell out real money.

To add on to that point, they should have some sort of button to press when you have to go and you are in the middle of a run, so when you have to go, you press the button and it saves the run so you can go back into the game another time. I also think that this games characters are a little over priced.  But that‚Äôs all I have to say on the negative side of things.

Getting around 50 coins per mini-game, which can take multiple lives to complete, isn‚Äôt sufficient enough. In order to buy a life, 900 coins, you would have to play around 18 rounds just to get enough coins for ONE life. I do not pay money on games, never have never will, but it‚Äôs so frustrating that you may have one move left and instead of paying real cash, not in game coins, you have to wait for a life to replenish just to try and fail at the level again. Each round can take 10+ lives to complete, and it takes quite awhile for the lives to replenish. There should be some kind of reward opportunity other than completing a day, especially because you need to play the mini-games to get stars, in order to complete tasks, to complete the day. That‚Äôs a lot of tasks to do with not a lot of lives/coin rewards!!! If there were events where you can play other mini-games to gain rewards/treasures I think it would be more efficient.

But one thing that bugs me is that; After a round an ad plays, right? Sometimes I get an 30 second long unskippable ad. And the game goes on without me and the server gets full. Then it kicks me out and says ‚ÄúThis server is full‚Äù I know you probably cannot stop this from happening. But I have no one else to talk to so I only have you guys.Update: Oh! And I forgot, sometimes people make servers and people join, only to get kicked or blocked by the host. I don‚Äôt understand why people do this. What do they get out of it you ask? Nothing. Can you please make a limit of how many people you can kick? Or perhaps rules I am sincerely sorry if this problem has been fixed. But I haven‚Äôt seen it with my own eyes happen to ME, but I‚Äôve seen it happen to others.Update: I‚Äôve now discovered that the ‚ÄúAutomatic role‚Äù system is very bad for me. I‚Äôve gotten Crewmate almost all of the time. Now it‚Äôs rare if I even get imposter ONCE. I try every single day. But now it‚Äôs a very boring app for me since all I get is Crewmate and always get killed first, then have to deal with dumb people who see the body but just stand by it without reporting, then another person comes in and thinks it that person since they‚Äôre standing near the body.",Or perhaps rules I am sincerely sorry if this problem has been fixed.,5,True,reliability,negative,7

But it wasn‚Äôt always that way...if you find and defeat the forden (A small mob that is is visible but will fade if you look at it.) If you find the power source that causes this mob to fade you cow destroy it. That mob will drop something called the Fax enchantment to gloves (which y‚Äôall should add too) and you touch something the whole world will spring with life. Then a door will appear out of no where to take you back to the over world when you are ready. This will also contain Force oars and on and on. 3rd, A time traveler. If you kill a wither, enderdragon, and forden, they will drop something called Broken map. If you place the three pieces together it will unlock something called a time traveler.

I‚Äôve been trying to get Yutani for a long time(like 3 years now and I still have like a 100 more to go) so please  make it a shorter time to get characters. Also, please make keys more common. Once you try to press save me, it‚Äôs only like one key. But after like 3 times, it‚Äôs like 20 KEYS!!! Also, the pop up ads. THEY ARE SO ANNOYING!!! THEY JUST GET ON MY NERVES SO MUCH! Please, please, PLEASE REMOVE THEM!!! One more thing, the new characters. They are so expensive!!! Please make them cheaper. If you don‚Äôt have, let‚Äôs say, about 400,000 coins and that‚Äôs how much a character you really want your not going to be able to get it because it‚Äôs so expensive. You can‚Äôt earn that much in a month. Soon it disappears because the month‚Äôs over and your super bummed out. So you have to pay real money for coins and I don‚Äôt like that.

The animation is lovely, the load times are quick, and, of course, Monopoly is just fun to play. My only quibble is the programming of the computer players. As far as I can tell, the only differences between the easy and hard modes are the likelihood that the computer players will elect not to buy a property or make a bizarre trade. I find that the game is artificially difficult at times because the computer players frequently make unreasonable trades that savvy human players would never make. For example, Dog will make a trade with Penguin that gives Penguin an orange monopoly (at a time when Penguin has tons of money and can immediately build it up to four houses per property). In exchange, Dog got a second red property that Dog can‚Äôt do anything with (because I have the third red property). So Dog gives Penguin an almost insurmountable advantage early in the game for no obvious strategic reason. It seems like a minor gripe in the grand scheme of things, but similar scenarios happen fairly often, which makes the game less fun at times.",My only quibble is the programming of the computer players.,4,True,effectiveness,negative,2

The levels are hard, but they want you to continuously spend money on coins etc.. to try to win or put in an ad about other versions of this game.  It gets frustrating and you want to put the game down and never return.  Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre rewarded with an hour or more of free play,  it ticks down from that minute instead of letting you go in and play on your own schedule and let it tick down.  Some of us work for a living and may play during our lunch or break, if you activate the free time, it is ticking down and over when you are off work and can play.  The creators want you to acquire other versions/themes of the game.. if they‚Äôre like this one.. no way I‚Äôd get them.  Funny that in the garden today while sweeping the butler says how he like to keep the dust out of the carpets there and keeps a clean house ( same thing he says in the house.. you should change the text to match the scenes)  the guitar is in the house, but it magically appeared for him to sit on a bench and play it while chastising me about how hard the game must be for me to play.  when you lose each life, the look on characters face is like you‚Äôre a failure... this doesn‚Äôt encourage you to play, you want to avoid that look like the plague.   At times it‚Äôs disheartening.

First of all when the game updated it basically restarted the game and got rid of all my coins, keys, characters...everything. I am pretty mad about that because it took a long time to save up for all the characters I got. I‚Äôm really lucky because I didn‚Äôt use any money to buy anything. If I did and they deleted everything then that would mean I just spent and wasted a whole lot of money. And I‚Äôm pretty sure that is what happened to other people who bought stuff using real money. Another thing is the design. It‚Äôs not that great. The graphics and layout are really childish. And now for some reason the game takes FOREVER to load. And it also for some reason only works at a certain time of day. It didn‚Äôt do that before this terrible update came out.

One last thing, smart AI for Freeplay. I read someone else‚Äôs review and I too would love to have smarter AI as an option. This game is amazing. Edit: so I just had an idea. For the Charles headphone hat, maybe there could be an alternative broken headphones because of the Valiant Hero ending? Edit 2: sorry if a bunch of people are dumping a lot of ideas in you, but I had an idea just now. What if there are different body types for different kill animations? For example, if the impostor literally backstabs you, your body could be face down on the floor with their hand reaching out. Or when the impostor impales you with their tongue, it could be a body with a hole in its head. Thanks for reading!

I have come across some really disgusting conversations within the game between people. If kids starting from the age of 9+ can play this game there should be a way to report people saying explicit inappropriate things. Each person should get a profile and there should be a system of reporting people. Yes you can kick people out of a server but you have to also get three other people to do too or be the one who made the server. There needs to be a better system in place. There has been a time where I entered a server and someone was trying to get personal information out of a 12 year old (at least that is how old the person said they were). That is NOT okay. Luckily other people within the server stepped in and we told the kid not to share that information but there really needs to be a system in place. There have also been times of people bullying other people. This is also not okay and just another reason there needs to be a way to report people for misconduct. I did not find this game to have a safe environment for me or for children. It is a great concept but not at all what I would consider safe for children at the age of 9.

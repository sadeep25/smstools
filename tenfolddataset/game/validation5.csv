Great challenge system implemented; giving players “Milestones” looking forward. Games like this can easily be repetitive, the challenge system doesn’t completely take that away but definitely helps. Great app for the current version, runs perfect on my iPhone SE. if I could change anything it would possible be different subway backgrounds to give a different feel for where you maybe few examples “abandoned subway” like the one in Cincinnati Ohio, or New York or Boston type of Subway. I’m sure the devs could possibly implement something of that nature rather simple. Then you could make a “premium” version thus driving more revenue to make more great games. Possibly more power ups to run with, premium players would get access to free power ups once a month maybe 5 of each that can be “stackable” and do not expire. Just a few ideas and an actual helpful review not someone crying about how the game restarted on them or bashing you for bugs that nearly every app will encounter here and there.

It helps me with keeping calm and it’s endless running. However, there is an annoying glitch in the game that makes me angry. Every time an add plays in the game, it always makes my character crash into one of the train carts. This is a problem that must be fixed or no one will want to play it. I do not recall anyone who has this problem that I know, but that is because most of my friends do not play Subway surfers. There is also a problem with the new “tankbot”. I purchased him a day ago and it was a waste of my time and money. It took me forever to purchase this character because it said “loading”. But it took me about 10 minutes to get this character and use it for the first time because of this purchase. Tank bot also crashed every time and my phone froze completely. When it unfroze and I played again, it happened again. I do not remember this happening when I use Zoey or any of the other characters. Please fix that and if you do, I will give a better review. I cannot enjoy games that I cannot play. I switched my character back to zoey and it works just fine now. But I want your company to fix “ the tank bot problem”. Thank you 🙏🏻!

My family thinks I’m insane and I shouldn’t play it as much as I do, but it’s my go to game when I’m bored. But, I recently had some trouble yesterday. So I was saving up for all five of the Christmas people, and I finally got 100 keys, so I got it and then left the app. Then I went back in it later and it said I had 93 keys... I was super confused, so I went into the me section where my boards and characters are to see if I still had my Christmas people, but I accidentally bought a character. And I also had the Christmas people too. After being way too confused I got out for the day. Then, this morning i went on to get my daily snowflakes and words and it wouldn’t let me watch an ad when I died. I had to use keys. Now, I still had 30-something, but if I continued like that, with the amount of time I spend on the game, those keys would be gone super soon. So, if anyone can help me or tell me what happened, that would be great, thanks. (Btw I would rate this a five star but I also want to get attention of the creator or help desk or whatever so I rated my review a one star.

I greatly regret buying them, though. The more you buy, the less the game works.

That’s fine, but the problem is you have to scroll through dozens and dozens of blank decks to get to the decks you’ve paid for. There is no way to rearrange, prioritize, or delete decks. There is also no way to contact support to tell them of these issues or ask for a refund, since the game doesn’t work.","I greatly regret buying them, though.",3,True,cost,negative,1

I would really like being able to use emojis in game because I ( my opinion ) REALLYYYY like to express my feelings with emojis. I’m not sure if most people agree why we should add emojis but I’m pretty sure a few of us want emojis. 😉 The second thing is friending each other. Sometimes I make friends but then ( because of my un-lucky life.. ) I always have to go! Then when I tell them, I get so sad because they are my friends!

I had a property of every color in my last game to ensure no one can build, so what happens? Yup, I land on their railroads only. So what do I do? I buy one of their railroads for a ridiculous price. The next turn, the computer acquired a railroad from another computer to re up the price. I know what you are thinking, why wouldn’t they buy that railroad prior so that they had all 4? Nah, only when I take the railroad away are they ALL OF A SUDDEN interested. It’s insanity how much they fix the games in favor of the computer.

Each update is better then the last, adding amazing animals and new objects. However I have noticed in the recent update, TONS of new bugs and issues have occurred. Such as, sometimes when I am crafting something, I craft it and then go back in the crafting table. But my item is still there. I try to remove it, but it just replaces itself with another one. I end having to close the app and reopen it. Another problem that has recently developed is, whenever I go into chat when I am on a sever, my game immediately freezes, then crashes and knocks me out of the app. Another thing that has recently happened is when I am playing and go into my inventory, it freezes and won’t unfreeze. One more is, sometimes when I go into the nether, it stays frozen on the “loading terrain” screen. Other than these glitches and bugs, I HIGHLY recommend this game. Whenever I want to play a fun game, this will always be my first choice. With the endless building ideas, the challenge of defeating the bosses, and playing countless games and tests Minecraft is the best game out there and will make you play for hours.

The game rarely glitched and overall was the best mobile game I’d found in a while. But after this last update I can’t say that anymore. I love the idea of not showing who voted who ( it really helps with the occasional bullies) and I like the point of the update. Next I will say what I would like you to add adding friends, maybe more maps ( I like the ones you have but a big Change like that sound good), no hacking ( it’s still happening just not the full game bug you guys had), and actual bug fixes. Let me explain the last one or why I can’t say I love the game anymore. Earlier today I was playing with my younger sister and teaching her to play, sounds fun right? Well it was but soon after we had to make a new game bc people weren’t able to stay on our game with being kicked off for no reason. So me and her tried making a new game and it basically told us we had been M.I.A when the game hadn’t even loaded yet. Then we gave up. Later that day i by myself tried playing a game and it kept telling me I have an old version of the game even tho it just updated a day before. So that brings us to now.

This new version is nowhere near as fun to play. Sure, it looks better, and there are more ways for you guys to make more $$ from it, but the new AI algorithm is simply a drag to play. With the old game, if I played 20 games, I could strategize and win about half of them. With this new version, I’ve won only once in 20 games! And that’s only because I refused to trade. The AI consistently ends up with more funds from giveaways and pays less taxes while the human pays more taxes and gets fewer random giveaways. Please rework the AI algorithm to make it a more enjoyable and better balanced game!!Reply to developer: I never accused the game of being “rigged.” As any programmer knows, there is no such thing as “random.” Programming any software takes human choice. My point was that the programming of the old version of Monopoly was more balanced than the present version, and as such, the present app needs to be reworked to be better balanced and more enjoyable to play.For version 1.3: the background (city) sounds are much too loud now! Can barely hear the sound of the board anymore. It’s the sound of the dice and playing pieces on the board that bring it alive for me. Please lower the city sounds back to where they were.

However, I do have a few critiques. I think the developers should add some unlock able content that you don’t have to pay extra for. I feel it would give more incentive for people to play the game. On another note it would be beneficial to add a friends list feature so you can play with others you meet online as well as people you know in person. Also I’m not a fan of the chat situation. I feel like an open chat forum would allow for more dexterity in the game. Instead you can only choose from pre-selected text which I find annoying at times because in real life it’s easier to make negotiations with others if you can say exactly what you what/mean.

I walk around and when i pull up the pause menu my custom skin is replaced with a random skin. And I sometimes see other players with my skin equipped. And idk if my skin is working or not. Even when i do the inventory menu my custom skin is still there. So Mojang, if you see this then please reach out to me. My Minecraft account is a Xbox live account named Endermen21YT.

Give bonus random coins for no reason or a closing jackpot at the end of each game or Room.  To spend and spend and never win anything back except 50 coins to 100 coins is disheartening.

The ads mostly show the lead character, Austin the Butler, in a sticky situation and the player has to pull levers to get him out of it. The actual game, however, is mostly improving the large house owned by Austin’s parents.  The sticky situations are called “Austin’s Bad Dream and in 35 levels, I have only been able to see a few of them.  The game is mostly playing a form of Candy Crush to earn stars in order to improve the home. That part is not so bad. The music is pleasant and the game is a relaxing time waster, at least initially. I don’t mind using the earned stars to replace furniture or a rug, but as the game goes on, you have to use the stars to do just about anything like answering the door, unpacking a TV, or even starting a new day. And once you’re out of stars, you can’t do anything else until you have won more candy crush games and earned more stars. You earn one star from winning each candy crush game no matter how difficult the game is. Win in one round, earn one star. Win after 20 rounds, earn one star. The idea of course is to get the player to purchase items to play longer. I get it. Most games I have seen do the same thing, but they don’t ramp up the difficulty so quickly.","Win in one round, earn one star.",3,True,general,positive,5

If 5 mores moves is not enough to complete the level the next 5 cost 1200 coins. The puzzles are designed to require boosts or additional moves. Each puzzle won rewards a star. Stars are required to perform actions for upgrading the garden or home. Though it is satisfying to watch the transformations and improvements I get frustrated when required to spend a star to greet someone at the door to receive a package, then another star to open the package. All the extra actions not related to actual upgrades seems like a complete waste of stars considering the difficulty of obtaining them.

One of my biggest complaints is the fact that you cannot do something as little as pull down your notification screen a smidge without being forced to bear a 20 second+ dimmed out “Rejoining game...” screen. That’s ridiculous. Why should it take that long to get back in the game when I hardly even left? The connection errors/bugs are ridiculous and make it rare to get a solid game in. That’s unacceptable, really. What’s the point in playing a game that’s likely to crash because of bugs? Also, the lack of any form of communication between players is upsetting. Seriously, no chat box? No ability to use our microphones? You want to charge $4 for a board game and not let us speak to each other? They’re also charging $30 for a season pass that I believe features strictly cosmetics. 🙄 Marmalade, if you want our money at least give us a solid game. Another complaint I have is the only games rules we have to choose from are: Classic and Quick mode. It would be nice to have the options to change the rules/play custom games and whatnot. To the Monopoly fans, tread carefully because this game was clearly developed as a cash grab and not to give us the mobile Monopoly we would expect in 2020.

Me and my friends love playing servers together and being able to friend other users could make it easier to game together. Also a microphone feature would be great. Chatting with the other users whilst playing out loud could be really great, because you’d be talking instead of typing through a screen. You’d be able to pick a game with microphone chatting or without, just whatever you prefer personally. Also being to branch out into private chats with people in the server would be really good. That way you could discuss plans with fellow imposters and win in a better and more strategized way. Also you could chat with friends you’re playing with separately. It would add a better feature of strategy and even betrayal to the game. You could even use it for persuasion purposes.

For a relatively simple game, it creates surprising amounts of tension, and with the right group of players, the experience can be a total blast. So, why the mediocre rating? Innersloth recently released what I can only describe as a ruinous, game-breaking update. Firstly, disconnections are frequent; in a game whose structure relies upon every player living long enough to cast out the killer(s) before meeting either win/loss condition, losing those players to disconnection means one less pair of hands for tasks, one less vote per meeting, one less identity to hide among, or one less partner to kill crewmates. If it were just one, a person could grouse and learn to get over it. But it is many. The problem is large enough to merit redress. And there are game-ending graphical errors, too. From time to time, avatars glitch through/into walls, or walk into out-of-bounds areas. I even lost a game once where I thought I broke another player’s alibi because she claimed to be someplace, but she was plainly visible right next to me. Turns out she wasn’t a liar—my game was just glitchy. Post-game glitches often mean rebooting and losing your lobby, which is the end of the world, but can be really demoralizing when you finally find a cool group to play with.

It’s a great game to play with friends and family, whether you want to create a massive structure or survive in the wilderness while fighting monsters, or do a bit of both. However, like every game, it does need some improvements. First of all, I suggest that it have a wider variety of animals in the game, (elephants, lions, tigers, sharks, etc). Also, I think their should be more options of furniture, especially in creative mode, rather than having to use steps as chairs. There are also a few glitches that can be annoying.

Black Bear. A bear with a brown snout, brown belly, and all the rest is black fur. It can only be found in Taiga (spruce forest) biomes. It has the same body that the polar bear does. It eats raw fish of any type and sweet berries, but you cannot tame them, you can only breed them (just like the foxes). They can spawn when the world is in peaceful, easy, normal, or hard. But when it is peaceful, when you attack them they won’t attack you back. But when it isn’t in peaceful when you attack one, they deal 4 hearts when the player is in survival. 3. Penguin. It only spawns in snowy plains and on icebergs. They eat raw fish of any type, but you cannot tame them, you can only breed them. They have a white belly and the rest is all-black.

I loved watching the garden change and feeling I had a say in just how it looked. I even paid attention to Austin’s in-game FB posts and enjoyed when he had visitors. Then...it got harder and harder to pass levels. I have little money to spend so I rarely buy “helps” but I do write reviews when I love a game and tell friends to check it out. I haven’t played Gardenscapes for weeks now—though I sometimes open it up to look at how pretty the garden is and to tell Austin I’m still on vacation and to take care of the house. With the Homescapes game I am enjoying a feeling of accomplishment again but I assume that too will soon end. I think the developers have made it way too hard to make any progress that the discouragement way outweighs any fun. Why not give us a way to earn more points (rather than watching commercials about other games—and even that doesn’t get you much)? I almost deleted Gardenscapes last week I was so frustrated. Then decided to try carpet and furniture rather than fountains and flowers.

The levels are so hard and the payout is so low. I’m deleted the game today because I don’t spend “real” money on games, especially when there isn’t a good return. The amount of coins that are needed to buy things like boosters and lives are crazy high. 900 coins for 5more moves on a level is crazy and then if you want to do it again, it’s 1200! When you only win between 50 and 100 coins ( on a really good round) it takes a really long time to recoup. They are very stingy with giving you boosters and chances to get more coins. I play other games that are very generous with coins and boosters which allows me to play and enjoy the game. Isn’t that what the game should be all about? Challenging levels are one thing, but when it takes so many lives to win a level it’s not fun anymore. I won 2 hours, played constantly for that time and only made it through 2 levels. Also, when you win 2or 3 hours of free play, it should be put away so I can play when I want to.

The most recent major annoyance is the red exclamation point on the Shop button. After I click the daily reward and the offers, the red exclamation point still remains. What the heck?!? I don’t want to keep seeing it. Yes, I know there are special offers, and the daily reward is ready, but what else? The third annoyance is ads within ads. What is this new type of purgatory? I see a screen playing a different ad within the ad that’s playing. And the last annoyance (for now, anyway) is that the sound is not always off even when the phone is on silent. What if I were in an important board meeting and surreptitiously playing Subway Surfers and the sound for the ad bursts out? If I silence the game, I expect the ads to be silenced as well.

If a player gets too powerful too early the game will purposely miss that players monopolies to almost absurd amount. I had six hotels on one side of the board and all other three players missed me for three complete cycles around the board. Still I couldn’t prove this until my last online game where I was able to quickly dominate the left side of the board with three hotels and four houses on each property for the other monopoly. I had just built the four houses and “rolled the dice” I landed on community chest and was asset building repairs. This should have been impossible since there are only two repair cards one for chance and the other for community chest. The community chest repair card had come up earlier and I counted the amount of cards played. It was seven. Since there are only 16 cards in community chest it should not have come up again for at least 8 more cards.  Game is entertaining but certainly not random.

Now I can’t stop playing it. All I can say is thank you, bringing us entertainment for all these years. This game has been there sense the start and came out rough into the best sandbox game I have ever played. Sure there are some negatives about the game, like you can’t get custom skins off files on Xbox without having to decrepit the games files. I always had used MCPE skin creator/editor and it worked amazingly but sad to know I can only do it on mobile. But put that aside, and you have an overall 90/10 game right now for me it’s perfect as it is.

For example, every task around the house goes from costing one star to two. The rewards aren’t sufficient to the amount of boosts being spent on harder levels. Some levels are so hard and waste so many lives that you have to use boosts just to get through it. There should be more levels that don’t take multiple tries to get through. Some of the tasks that the game makes you do are stupid. The game is trying to get you to use all your stars so you have to play more, which is typical, but with the levels so hard, it’s really just a tactic to get people to spend more money. It’s also takes way too long for the lives to reload. It’s like 25mins per life. I really liked this game at the start but the further I’ve gotten, the less I want to continue playing. Instead of throwing in so many different aspects into the puzzle games so soon, they should have waited and made it harder much later. I’m only in the kitchen and I spend on average 3-5 lives on each level. I try not to use boosters because they are so hard to earn. Paying 900coins to get 5 more moves on one level, when each level earns you roughly 50-70 coins (hard levels earn you 100+) is just sad.

The levels with soap bubbles or oil spreading while you try to keep it at bay while solving the actual puzzle is ridiculous and next to impossible.

ESPECIALLY when, if you don’t have time to stop your day to use that surprise time, it goes away.

I love the idea behind this game, and all the creativity included. candy crush is one of my favorite games as well, but I also really like to organize and design houses and rooms too, so this is just the perfect game for me! games such as home design really interest me because it’s super fun to decorate homes, and tie the them together with pictures and furniture. although, sometimes, the levels can be a little hard and I don’t have enough money in the game to continue on a level. eventually I learned the tips and tricks though, and I’m nearly a pro! my brother also really enjoys this game, but finds it to be slightly challenging at his age. of course, he is still quite young so it’s understandable. plus, I really like teaching him how to do it and helping him with it. i like how it walks you through all of the events in Austin’s life, too! absolutely amazing design on that! progression through this game is just so fun, and I’m always excited to sit down and play. anyways, I really love this game and recommend it to everyone out there who is willing to go on an adventure through a screen.","my brother also really enjoys this game, but finds it to be slightly challenging at his age.",5,True,enjoyability,positive,4

First, i wanna say that the game’s interface is very well designed. It’s like playing the actual game on another level. Second, i like how we have the option to play the QUICK mode since this game is naturally takes forever (which is nice somehow) to end. Third and on the bad side, i wish there is a way for an actual chat rather than the pre wording that is not even applicable for every scenario. EG, if trading cards, reasoning for trades or refuse etc. that would be like the actual game and that will add the excitement in playing. Also, themes, boards, and tokens are way expensive. Would be nice since the game itself is paid, features should be lesser the price and not higher than the actual game. Lastly, on that note i wish there is an option to add the player as a friend for future game. That will actually make the experience more real rather than it’s always random guest and while playing with random people, you can’t add any of those players per say. Overall nice game. Worth the money. But these improvements will make it more fun to play the game.","Also, themes, boards, and tokens are way expensive.",4,True,cost,negative,1

This new version is nowhere near as fun to play. Sure, it looks better, and there are more ways for you guys to make more $$ from it, but the new AI algorithm is simply a drag to play. With the old game, if I played 20 games, I could strategize and win about half of them. With this new version, I’ve won only once in 20 games! And that’s only because I refused to trade. The AI consistently ends up with more funds from giveaways and pays less taxes while the human pays more taxes and gets fewer random giveaways. Please rework the AI algorithm to make it a more enjoyable and better balanced game!!Reply to developer: I never accused the game of being “rigged.” As any programmer knows, there is no such thing as “random.” Programming any software takes human choice. My point was that the programming of the old version of Monopoly was more balanced than the present version, and as such, the present app needs to be reworked to be better balanced and more enjoyable to play.For version 1.3: the background (city) sounds are much too loud now! Can barely hear the sound of the board anymore. It’s the sound of the dice and playing pieces on the board that bring it alive for me. Please lower the city sounds back to where they were.

The ads mostly show the lead character, Austin the Butler, in a sticky situation and the player has to pull levers to get him out of it. The actual game, however, is mostly improving the large house owned by Austin’s parents.  The sticky situations are called “Austin’s Bad Dream and in 35 levels, I have only been able to see a few of them.  The game is mostly playing a form of Candy Crush to earn stars in order to improve the home. That part is not so bad. The music is pleasant and the game is a relaxing time waster, at least initially. I don’t mind using the earned stars to replace furniture or a rug, but as the game goes on, you have to use the stars to do just about anything like answering the door, unpacking a TV, or even starting a new day. And once you’re out of stars, you can’t do anything else until you have won more candy crush games and earned more stars. You earn one star from winning each candy crush game no matter how difficult the game is. Win in one round, earn one star. Win after 20 rounds, earn one star. The idea of course is to get the player to purchase items to play longer. I get it. Most games I have seen do the same thing, but they don’t ramp up the difficulty so quickly.","The actual game, however, is mostly improving the large house owned by Austin’s parents.",3,True,enjoyability,positive,4

I refresh the servers, and there’s barely any. I try another one, same problem. I’m usually spending at least 2-3 minutes just trying to join a game with settings I like. Another thing that happens a lot is that when I refresh the servers, there’s none available! I’m not sure if this is a me problem, but PLEASE fix this!! It’s been a month or so since you said updates and Airship(The new map) were coming to Among Us, where are they!? There’s probably a bunch of people getting impatient, you really gotta hurry up.Suggestions: A friending system, I’ve met so many nice people when playing! It would be nice for a friending system! Another suggestion is more customization, there’s only 12 colors along with a not so massive selection of hats. I’m not allowed to buy anything online, so it would be cool for more customization for people that can’t afford to buy more hats and things! My final suggestion is MORE GAMEMODES!!!

But recently the game was updated so that anyone under the age of 18 can not type what they want or need to say. I see that they were trying to fix the problem of swearing and online dating but it just wasn’t the right way to fix the problem. The game used to be so enjoyable, and now I probably won’t be playing it again. There are many other ways to fix this problem, but restricting what people can type so that they can’t get their point across is not the way to do it. If this was removed I definitely would give it a 5 star review, but unfortunately this update has ruined the game for me, my friends and my family.EDIT: I won’t be playing the game again I’ve tried to get over the update but I can’t. To be honest you ruined your own game. The bulk of people that play are teens and now we have no freedom. We get all of these restrictions everywhere and you had to add among to that list. I’m very disappointed. If you could lower the age for safe chat from 18 to 13 that would be great. 18 is very unrealistic compared to 13 which is much more reasonable. Also look at all of the reviews your getting. People aren’t happy and your star level is dropping. I’ll let that speak for itself. Just change the game back or tweak the update please. I also just deleted the app. I have no patience for things like this. Please fix the app!!!!! 😡😡😡",EDIT: I won’t be playing the game again I’ve tried to get over the update but I can’t.,1,True,effectiveness,negative,2

At the bottom of the screen there were options of what you need to do first, what you need to use to fix it, and if you choose the wrong thing you lose. It said why is this game so hard. Dumping a gasoline can onto a fire causes you to lose. This game is nothing like they advertised so that was a huge let down. Other than that, the game is fun. I like the switching tiles game to earn points and I like to redecorate the house.

The ads mostly show the lead character, Austin the Butler, in a sticky situation and the player has to pull levers to get him out of it. The actual game, however, is mostly improving the large house owned by Austin’s parents.  The sticky situations are called “Austin’s Bad Dream and in 35 levels, I have only been able to see a few of them.  The game is mostly playing a form of Candy Crush to earn stars in order to improve the home. That part is not so bad. The music is pleasant and the game is a relaxing time waster, at least initially. I don’t mind using the earned stars to replace furniture or a rug, but as the game goes on, you have to use the stars to do just about anything like answering the door, unpacking a TV, or even starting a new day. And once you’re out of stars, you can’t do anything else until you have won more candy crush games and earned more stars. You earn one star from winning each candy crush game no matter how difficult the game is. Win in one round, earn one star. Win after 20 rounds, earn one star. The idea of course is to get the player to purchase items to play longer. I get it. Most games I have seen do the same thing, but they don’t ramp up the difficulty so quickly.","Win after 20 rounds, earn one star.",3,True,cost,positive,1

Then, if you want another 5, you have to spend 1200!!!!! That is messed up. 2: the parents don’t give you enough credit. You work really hard to get just one star (which I will complain about later) and you choose what you like, but the parents (mostly the dad) are just “eh, it’s nice, but we’re are still gonna sell the house.” It’s like you can’t do anything that’s good enough for them! 3: I do not like the fact that you only get 1 star per game. 1 star!!! We could be making MILLIONS of stars if the game let us get one star every time we make a power-up! It’s just not fair. Now, I love the game, but the thing is that sometimes you’re not there when the game gives you free lives for only 30 minutes. I’m not always there, which in other words, it’s a waste of lives.

Getting disconnected is way too common, it happens when you get notification, when you click off the game for a split second, when you get a call, when you get a low battery warning, or poor wifi connection. The game can stop and crash at any point in the game. I wasted 2 hours playing a round just so it could crash mostly every single time. Out of the 35 games I’ve played, I only got through 7 of them. Mind you, I had to pay for this app. It’s ridiculous. DONT BUY THIS APP unless they start making changes and improvements to it. Also they do not have any type of communication system so you can’t talk to your opponents. That should be included in the game to communicate with your opponents, negotiate for trades, or just to simply remind your opponents to end the game.

I understand that with freedom of speech comes those who use for unsavory acts but the whole point of a mafia/among us type game is to be deceptive or as honest as possible. I don’t know how I’m really supposed to play when all that is said is player names and “lies” or “no” or “idk”. I hope that the devs at least allow for people to change whether or not to have chat wheels in the game, as I could see that helping with the progress of the game even further, with new ideas coming into play like how people thought of hide n seek for it. At the very least, I think that if the devs want the game to come back, because I know a lot of people will leave it because of this, then they should work on ways of allowing people to have they freedom or not with the chat. Inner sloth, if you read this, thanks for all the hard work you have put into among us, and I’m really glad to have played it, but please consider this change that I know others would want along with me.

It’s super fun even when your not playing with friends. I know many people have an opinion on this (most of them good) so I just thought I spread the word even more. I feel like you should really add a friend system! That way you can send friend requests to people you would like to join’s game. Something that I find very annoying, is when your in the middle of playing, then get kicked out and it says: “Sent 6 pings” or the “unreliable packet source” or something. Its really annoying how you can be playing and then boom. Back to the main menu you go! So that’s something I would like if you fixed it. And finally, the trolls. I hate when people will join a game and ask “hey any (insert gender) here?” “What’s ur snap?” “Hey how old are you?” It’s really uncomfortable. Also when people say inappropriate things like private things to other strangers. It gets me disgusted. So I thought something thst could help with that is banning. If someone is beign really rude,or innapropriate I (and many others) would appreciate it if the game can ban them for maybe 30 minutes. So they can still play, but it’s later.

This new version is nowhere near as fun to play. Sure, it looks better, and there are more ways for you guys to make more $$ from it, but the new AI algorithm is simply a drag to play. With the old game, if I played 20 games, I could strategize and win about half of them. With this new version, I’ve won only once in 20 games! And that’s only because I refused to trade. The AI consistently ends up with more funds from giveaways and pays less taxes while the human pays more taxes and gets fewer random giveaways. Please rework the AI algorithm to make it a more enjoyable and better balanced game!!Reply to developer: I never accused the game of being “rigged.” As any programmer knows, there is no such thing as “random.” Programming any software takes human choice. My point was that the programming of the old version of Monopoly was more balanced than the present version, and as such, the present app needs to be reworked to be better balanced and more enjoyable to play.For version 1.3: the background (city) sounds are much too loud now! Can barely hear the sound of the board anymore. It’s the sound of the dice and playing pieces on the board that bring it alive for me. Please lower the city sounds back to where they were.

The hoverboard mechanic was very responsive even at the higher speed late game. The physics were doing great for a game, but now the hoverboard lags at times, I was in a super late game run where I attempted to activate the hoverboard and it didn’t work until my 4th attempt at double tapping.

Maybe you can add some more interesting updates like a railway crossing with another train intersecting like a cross and the player has to jump through a hole in one of the cars. Or maybe a car crossroad where the cars are driving over the track and the player has to jump on the cars. How about a more interesting above-ground section when you use the jetpack so you can dodge different objects such as trees and parked bicycles.

The sticky situations are called “Austin’s Bad Dream and in 35 levels, I have only been able to see a few of them.  The game is mostly playing a form of Candy Crush to earn stars in order to improve the home. That part is not so bad. The music is pleasant and the game is a relaxing time waster, at least initially. I don’t mind using the earned stars to replace furniture or a rug, but as the game goes on, you have to use the stars to do just about anything like answering the door, unpacking a TV, or even starting a new day. And once you’re out of stars, you can’t do anything else until you have won more candy crush games and earned more stars. You earn one star from winning each candy crush game no matter how difficult the game is. Win in one round, earn one star. Win after 20 rounds, earn one star. The idea of course is to get the player to purchase items to play longer. I get it.

So, first off I would like to start this review off with talking about how much I love this game. I downloaded this game years ago and still love it. It’s ultimately a great game. Here’s some of my requests you should do. First off, could you guys please make the game where you don’t need wifi to be able to join people? It always makes road trips boring for me if I want to play minecraft with a friend. Also, if you guys could make it where people can share a wolf. My first wolf from the beginning passed away tonight due to a skeleton attack. Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone’s been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful. Also if you could make it where villagers, foxes, and mobs can be leashed. That’s all my requests for now. Thank you!",It’s ultimately a great game.,5,True,enjoyability,positive,4

I walk around and when i pull up the pause menu my custom skin is replaced with a random skin. And I sometimes see other players with my skin equipped. And idk if my skin is working or not. Even when i do the inventory menu my custom skin is still there. So Mojang, if you see this then please reach out to me. My Minecraft account is a Xbox live account named Endermen21YT.

Also, I think you should make like a friend thing where like you can befriend people in the game and they can send you ( or you send them) friend request and when either of you accept then you can chat with them and join the same game as them so you don’t have to go through like hundreds of other servers to see them again. And for the last, it would be nice to add Charles to the stickmin bundle (this isn’t really a problem but it would be cool to have him in UwU💞).

It drains the battery so quickly.  It freezes up which forces you to close it and open it again.  The trades the A.I. players make are ridiculous and play after play they repeat over and over even if you silence them for that turn.  Real players wouldn’t do half of this stuff   Sometimes it appears that the dice roll is not random.  Sometimes the chance or community chest cards can be the same thing on back to back draws. Who goes first, second, third is flawed because it depends upon how you are listed and who rolls the highest dice when playing against the A.I players.   Not as much animation is needed which may help the battery drain or at least give an option to turn some of that off. So many things in each turn slow the whole game down and could be altered to keep it moving. Why not put the property cards displaying in the lower right rather than taking up the whole screen.  Overall I enjoy the game but this one needs some work.  I get tired of it draining my battery quickly.",The trades the A.I.,3,True,learnability,negative,6

I checked a million times to see if it’s just a update or something like that but it’s not! It’s super glitchy too, me and my cousins usually play together but it’s been lagging a lot.

Once I asked my dad if I could download an app that subway surfers showed. He said no and so then I pressed the X. Now it shows it like 100 times and  its SO annoying. Every day of every round I have to keep on pressing a X. Like STOP. Another thing is that the power ups are so short! They only last like five seconds. I think they could fix that in one of there updates. Oh speaking of updates, I love how they change the setting, but why CHANGE your high score. Like seriously! Come on man. My high score was like 80,000. Well HIGHER! They completely reset my high score. At first I was confused because I was proud of my high score, and trying to beat it, but then IT GOT RESET!

I LOVE this game, considering how hard it is to find a murder mystery game that is fun, challenging, and overall a enjoyable game. And I gotta say, this game nails the classic murder mystery game vibe. Considering how easy it is to pick up and go, you can really play it whenever you want, which is awesome in on itself, but it only makes it even better is how it’s free on mobile, is so nice, and it’s one of the main reasons it got popular in the first place, almost anyone with a phone could get the game! Sure, the advertisements can be a bit annoying, but that is really a small hiccup in the game, and besides, a free game has to have some kind of advertisements to keep it alive, so it’s hardly even a problem. The only real issue I had with this game was connection issues, but again, the game overall kinda shadows out the issues. The tasks/mini games are probably one of the best parts about this game, each one feels fun to do, especially if you can get a rhythm for each task. And the fact that you can have small meetings to decide who they think the murderer/imposter is, is GENIUS. This makes the game run at a good pace, makes replay ability amazing, and overall a amazing game. So innersloth, I’m excited for the updates and ideas you have for this game in the future! Amazing work!","This makes the game run at a good pace, makes replay ability amazing, and overall a amazing game.",5,True,efficiency,positive,3

It is fun and easy to learn how to play, and it kills time while making us think. I believe the new tournaments are fun, but it needs more. The levels need to make it so more coins can be earned. If I earn the minimum coins per level (50) and play 10 levels, it still isn’t enough to get a retry on a particularly hard level. Now I do think the fact they are called “Hard Levels” makes it better for us to prepare, and definitely the coin amount there is worth it. But in order to pass a level, I spend almost 6-8 hearts if it’s extremely time-consuming and hard. There is still the issue with more prizes. I like the daily bonus, but after the seventh day, it sent me right back to the first day without any prizes. I believe it should be after the 7th day, you get all the prizes from day 1-6 at the same time, and then day 8 and on should have more until you reach every seventh day again. It’s a good way to make people play the game. There also need to be more tournaments that don’t give prizes based off places. I never get first place in the plane tournament, but in the knitting ball one, I got a lot of prizes and it made me feel more encouraged to try.

I’ve been playing exclusively for the last couple weeks because I tend to be obsessive. However, there are a couple things that need addressed, if possible. The algorithms don’t seem very random. When I am down on money, I usually start landing on Chance & Community Chest an awful lot and each card I get is to owe money somehow—or I’ll land on one of the tax squares. And my opponents won’t land on any of my streets with houses or hotels, but I sure will land on theirs. It’s very hard to win against the computer, even when opponents are set to easy. Not that I want an easy win. But it would be nice to not always lose every single game. The first game I played, I’d set my opponents to medium. I was in jail more than I got to play, so my next game I took them all to easy. Less jail time but still seem to have the crappy end of the stick.

When you join “Online Multiplayer”, and you’re playing, you can leave the app and come back however long later, and the game would continue from where you left off. This is the first evidence of AI in an online supposed real person mode. The second bit of evidence is that the AI trades at very specific rates: when you’re paying cash for a property, they want double the property price. If you offer too much lower than double, they’ll permanently reject the offer. Closer to double, and they’ll counter for double. Third bit of evidence is when they offer you a trade, and you decline. If they offered money, they’ll make another offer increasing their offer by 10$. Decline again, they’ll increase by 10$ again. And so on. Another issue is that on Multiplayer with friends, if you accidentally leave the app, you’re instantly replaced with an AI and there’s no way for you to rejoin. This makes your phone unusable other than to play the game if you don’t want to erase all the progress you’ve just made on a match with a friend. Please look into this.

I controlled all property and railroads from the go square to free parking, yes that includes the orange properties!  The opposing side only had boardwalk and park place. We both had hotels on all monopolies owned. For a numbered point of reference that’s 13 out of 20 to one side while the ai had 2 out of 20 on the opposing side. I recorded 12 cycles and I landed 8 out of 12 cycles on either one of his two squares while the ai landed only 9 times on my 13 squares out of the 12 cycles. Almost every cycle I landed on his two properties and yet many times the ai only landed on a chance, just visiting, income tax, or community passing through unscathed on my side of the board.

I’ve been playing cave game, now Minecraft for as long as it’s been out. I remember how you could press g or h and you could “Clone” yourself. The old days of classic. I remember when there was a girl in Minecraft, and the old avatars.. (Notch messed up a bit..) it’s a fun and awesome game. The days of beta were the best. I remember surprise Friday or Friday surprise, but then it stopped. Until an exception- Surprise Saturday. Ah yes. I remember why polar bears were added in the game, and the reason. Jeb’s wife (I think it’s Jeb’s..) liked polar bears, so that’s why they were added. The original Mobil lite version, and I remember when Minecraft PE was free. All this time it’s been downloaded in my cloud storage, so I never had to buy it. (Heh) This game never stops improving. But of course, I’m more of a Java version myself, of course. The days of me and the boys, staying up all night, gaming, building whatever we could. I also remember the day when Microsoft bought Mojang, or did they buy Minecraft? Anyways. The first minecon was about 30 people, mostly Notches’ family. The good ol days of Minecraft. A few things could be changed though. The shooting speed of skeletons is very high, I dislike that, I have some other things, but I don’t want to keep you from doing your jobs. Thanks so much for these amazing 12 years of Minecraft! You guys rock! I can’t wait for the cave update! :)",The good ol days of Minecraft.,5,True,enjoyability,positive,4

It helps the time go by quickly.  The only thing that bothers me is the hard and extra hard part of the game.  I realize that it breaks up the monotony, but, I spend days sometimes trying to beat the level.  But, it is good that the hard and extra hard are few and far between, so it’s not overwhelming, it’s a good change of pace. And, as others have said, rewards are few and far between as well.  Especially with the hard levels, the rewards are just this: your normal level low coin reward is doubled and you are rewarded with one extra star.  I know you have to make money in this venture, but, your doing it to the detriment of your customers.  There is a reason we play games that say that they are free, it’s because a lot of us do not have the funds to use actual money to progress farther in the game faster then the other players that can afford to use their hard earned money.  In conclusion, I think this game is well worth 5 stars, however, I did only give it 4 stars on account of the hard and very hard levels & the lack of well deserved rewards.  I think there should be better rewards and it should be a little easier to get stars.  Just my opinion for what it’s worth.  But, great game!",I think there should be better rewards and it should be a little easier to get stars.,4,True,reliability,negative,7

I played it with my friend almost every day. But then the update happened. And it changed a lot. Before the update I couldn’t wait for the new map to come out. It wouldn’t come out so I deleted the app and reinstalled it. The reinstalled version had the update. First of all, it asks you to type in your birthday. And if you’re under 13 or whatever age it is, it won’t even let you chose your own name! What’s up with that? However it did have the new map. But with the new update I can only use the quick chat thingy which stinks. Anyway, I tried joining a game and when the game was about to tell if I’m crewmate or imposter or whatever the screen goes black and nothing happens. So I close out of the app and delete the app. When I re-downloaded it it didn’t let me chose my age again, so I was stuck with the non-custom name and the quick chat. Anyway I joined a game and my screen turned black when the game started again! So I deleted the app, reset my phone, and reinstalled it and the same things happened again! So, now I guess I can’t play among us anymore.

I like how you can put different types of explosives together or two of the same to make a bigger explosive. It would be even greater if you could put more than two together. I've had three explosives lined together but I can't mix all three together. I haven't had 4 or more alined but that would be more awesome.

The only reason I am writing this review is to tell people that what they are saying about it is not true and lies. First of all you have to wait ( like 5-20 min ) to get back in a game because you have left a game to much they are trying to prevent you from being one of those people that join a game just to leave. I know that might be frustrating but they are trying to make your experience better so stop complaining it could be much worse. The second thing I would like to address is that all the people are saying “ I barley moved an inch and they said orange vented,” well I am sorry to break it to you people are like that and they are just guessing to try to get you out so don’t complain. The last thing i want to address is people are saying they can’t get into the game because it is full even though it is 1/10. Well think about it there are millions of people trying to get into a game so they pick a game quick. My overall opinion of the game is great because there are no adds, it is just fun, you have weird and colorful skins, you can join publicly or private with your friends, there is democracy, and you get to chat.  ( i understand sometimes the chats can be inappropriate but then just leave the game) I did 4 stars because no game is perfect and there is minor glitching with colors but that’s really it.",I know that might be frustrating but they are trying to make your experience better so stop complaining it could be much worse.,4,True,effectiveness,negative,2

I mean of all the the video games, why did my first one have to be this? Well, I actually got introduced by my classmates , whom have recently discovered the game. When we would ask what did you do for the weekend Amoung us would be a popular game they all played. After a while, I found myself wanting to play the game more and more. I downloaded the app and found myself loving it! The game was relatively easy to play, and fun. While, I enjoyed the game their were still some downsides. One of the major cons was the gaming community in the app. People can have offensive name, and bully people without getting kicked out of the game. Many of the hosts do not seem bothered by this,  and don’t even think to ban or kick these people from the game.  As time went by I found the game less entertaining and it became boring. Even with the different maps, which I have tried; all the game is finish task look off suspicion and repeat. I really thought it be more of a challenge. It is challenging in its own way though, like collaboration with people. It can be hard to reason with people. For the reasons above , I quite the game. I still, want to give a shout out to the game developers for providing some fun, and hope they pay attention to my complaints.

So here's what happened: I was playing Subway Surfers for most of the day, during car rides and stuff, whenever I had a little free time. But on this day I just couldn't die. I used over 80 hoverboards, 1 key and amassed over 4000 coins and a wrecking 3 million score. This was done over a accumulated time of two hours. It was awesome. But I had to go to sleep. I left the app open with my phone charging and went to bed. The next morning, I went straight to my phone, unlocked it, and since it was left on Subway Surfers, it went to Subway Surfers.  Here is where I know most people would be incredibly angry; this is a 3-million-2-hour-score, you know? Instead of going to the ""paused"" part, the app RESTARTED!!! I could've thrown my phone, thrown chairs or whatever, but here I am writing a review. I haven't played the app since, and here's additional information: So I also have the game 2048.

It helps me with keeping calm and it’s endless running. However, there is an annoying glitch in the game that makes me angry. Every time an add plays in the game, it always makes my character crash into one of the train carts. This is a problem that must be fixed or no one will want to play it. I do not recall anyone who has this problem that I know, but that is because most of my friends do not play Subway surfers. There is also a problem with the new “tankbot”. I purchased him a day ago and it was a waste of my time and money. It took me forever to purchase this character because it said “loading”. But it took me about 10 minutes to get this character and use it for the first time because of this purchase. Tank bot also crashed every time and my phone froze completely. When it unfroze and I played again, it happened again. I do not remember this happening when I use Zoey or any of the other characters. Please fix that and if you do, I will give a better review.

So, first off I would like to start this review off with talking about how much I love this game. I downloaded this game years ago and still love it. It’s ultimately a great game. Here’s some of my requests you should do. First off, could you guys please make the game where you don’t need wifi to be able to join people? It always makes road trips boring for me if I want to play minecraft with a friend. Also, if you guys could make it where people can share a wolf. My first wolf from the beginning passed away tonight due to a skeleton attack. Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone’s been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful. Also if you could make it where villagers, foxes, and mobs can be leashed. That’s all my requests for now. Thank you!",I downloaded this game years ago and still love it.,5,True,enjoyability,positive,4

It’s pretty frustrating and feel like the game is kinda rigged against me when I play like that (even when I put them on easy mode), but I still keep coming back. Just started playing some online players and it’s got a different feel from the computer, for sure. I would like there to be an option to be able to chat with my fellow players.Finally, for anyone who’s concerned about in-app purchases, just know that they’re absolutely not necessary to play the game and enjoy every second of it.","Just started playing some online players and it’s got a different feel from the computer, for sure.",4,True,efficiency,positive,3

BUT I have some requirements. Number one is EMOJIS. We really need some emojis to express how we fell and to make talking with others easier. I mean I’m trying to make faces with text and it doesn’t let me. Mostly it would just make talking with others more fun. Number two is microphone. We should be able to make the settings of a game to be microphone only because honestly it’s easier and takes less time to talk. Number three hide and seek game mode. I know you guys mentioned this when you announced Among Us 2 but you have cancelled it so I hope you add it to Among Us 1. Number four updates. Now I’m not complaining that mobile players get updates later I’m just saying that at the time I’m typing this everyday I get into an among us lobby at least once it says I need to update and then I go to the App Store and I can’t update. Now I don’t know how updates for this game work since I’ve never experienced an actual update for it before.

I woke up this morning to play everybody’s favorite board game when I noticed that the interface had changed slightly. Apparently, there were some ‘improvements to the interface’. I didn’t think it was I big deal at first until I hit a brick wall. You see, I was trying to buy a house on States Avenue and with the ‘improvements to the interface’ they’d added, the stupid Buy Houses button completely covered up the property, so good luck putting a house on States Avenue! (or Virginia Avenue, for that matter!) These ‘Improvements’ make it very hard to see what I was doing at times, but make it impossible to do certain things to other times. This makes the game virtually unplayable at times, particularly making certain plays like trading or mortgaging property or buying/selling houses. I’ve been playing this game a lot recently and only noticed this problem today, which means it updated last night for me to enjoy these ‘improvements to the interface’ today.

It’s fun, entertaining, and creative. But the LAG. Recently, a few days ago, when playing with my friend in a world, it kept kicking me out of the app, disconnecting me, yet I have full bars of internet. One time, when I was sleeping, it kicked me out. When I went back into the world, it kept me in the sleeping mode. However, whenever I put leave bed, it would kick me out of the app. Some side effects were my avatar got glitchy and laggy. I don’t know if it’s my device or not, but I cannot talk about it. Secondly, I would like if we can build all the materials except the blocks, (nether blocks, etc.). I hate that every time I see a horse, I have to change cheats on and change to creative to get a saddle.I would also like if we could make realistic things like tables, plates to put in our food in, chairs, etc. Although minor, it would still be a great update if it was actual c: Edit: I just dropped it down to 1 star, maybe even deserves zero for how much I disconnect and lag. It’s frustrating having to get kicked out, join back in, and it not being saved. I get kicked out every 5-10 min. Each time I turn off my wifi.

One last thing, smart AI for Freeplay. I read someone else’s review and I too would love to have smarter AI as an option. This game is amazing. Edit: so I just had an idea. For the Charles headphone hat, maybe there could be an alternative broken headphones because of the Valiant Hero ending? Edit 2: sorry if a bunch of people are dumping a lot of ideas in you, but I had an idea just now. What if there are different body types for different kill animations? For example, if the impostor literally backstabs you, your body could be face down on the floor with their hand reaching out. Or when the impostor impales you with their tongue, it could be a body with a hole in its head. Thanks for reading!

I have come across some really disgusting conversations within the game between people. If kids starting from the age of 9+ can play this game there should be a way to report people saying explicit inappropriate things. Each person should get a profile and there should be a system of reporting people. Yes you can kick people out of a server but you have to also get three other people to do too or be the one who made the server. There needs to be a better system in place. There has been a time where I entered a server and someone was trying to get personal information out of a 12 year old (at least that is how old the person said they were). That is NOT okay. Luckily other people within the server stepped in and we told the kid not to share that information but there really needs to be a system in place. There have also been times of people bullying other people. This is also not okay and just another reason there needs to be a way to report people for misconduct. I did not find this game to have a safe environment for me or for children. It is a great concept but not at all what I would consider safe for children at the age of 9.

This game takes the struggle out of someone having to be banker. A game dragging on for 10+hrs and people are always online playing. There were a few kinks with it in the beginning. But I am seeing that they are fixing it now. I am only giving it 4 stars because as of late a lot of the games I have been in the middle of playing will just not be able to resume. It will be someone else’s turn and they just never come out of their turn. I think their should be a time limit once they have handled they business. Otherwise you have to wait until they “end turn” & this creates problems in the game. My games were all lost and needed to be exited after this occurred and all that I worked for or played for was lost. This creates a waste of time. Which is pretty unfortunate but other than that this game is extremely fun. I purchased both the other boards the snow and the 1930’s board I love all of them. Wish the tokens were a bit cheaper and more options. Overall few bug fixes and this game is going to remain my favorite.

It is fun and easy to learn how to play, and it kills time while making us think. I believe the new tournaments are fun, but it needs more. The levels need to make it so more coins can be earned. If I earn the minimum coins per level (50) and play 10 levels, it still isn’t enough to get a retry on a particularly hard level. Now I do think the fact they are called “Hard Levels” makes it better for us to prepare, and definitely the coin amount there is worth it. But in order to pass a level, I spend almost 6-8 hearts if it’s extremely time-consuming and hard. There is still the issue with more prizes. I like the daily bonus, but after the seventh day, it sent me right back to the first day without any prizes. I believe it should be after the 7th day, you get all the prizes from day 1-6 at the same time, and then day 8 and on should have more until you reach every seventh day again. It’s a good way to make people play the game. There also need to be more tournaments that don’t give prizes based off places. I never get first place in the plane tournament, but in the knitting ball one, I got a lot of prizes and it made me feel more encouraged to try. This game is great but definitely needs more to attract more and lose less people.","I like the daily bonus, but after the seventh day, it sent me right back to the first day without any prizes.",4,True,enjoyability,positive,4

So it said I could buy it for $5.99 and I did, I played on it with my sisters for hours. I really liked it. This went on for a couple of weeks, but then one day it said it was locked and I had to buy City Life all over again, i was very mad. I already changed stuff in that world and I didn’t even know that If i rebought it, all my stuff would still be there. I was willing to rebuy because I thought it wouldn’t happen again and it was just an error Minecraft made. I played on it for an hour or two and I turned it off and didn’t touch it. The next day, I was excited to play on City Life again, but this time I was furious. It had been only 14 hours and it’s already saying I have to rebuy it again. I couldn’t stand it, i wasn’t going to buy it for the 3rd time in 3 weeks. Now I’m here hoping that this review will change something and I won’t have to pay for it EVER AGAIN.

If you decide to just stick with private mode then you will be absolutely fine. You can have a fun time with some friends and overall enjoy this game. But then I tried public games.It wasn’t as bad as you think it would be. I ran into a total of one weirdo and was totally fine. I had no problems. The only time something really weird happened was when somebody with a weird name had tried to get us to follow his/her Twitter, but thanks to the new update Among Us blocks your ability to redirect to another website in the chat. Here’s the thing though. Recently, I ran into another one of the weird-named people, and they said in the chat that the lobby was hacked and he/she had all of the players’ IP addresses. This was an empty threat, as IP addresses are public knowledge (and you can’t find out where you are based on them)and Apple phones are virtually impossible to hack. However, this really shook me up and I deleted Among Us immediately. I didn’t want to be hacked. EVER. It was kind of scary even though I knew the extensive anti-hacking measures taken place by InnerSloth (the game’s creator). While this game is fun, it’s not worth it being scared every time my friends aren’t up for a game. If you are getting this for a group of friends/family, then you are fine.

As far as games go this is the most addicting mobile game I’ve personally played. I’ve enjoyed it  since this game came to iOS and have even purchased some in-game cosmetic gear. I just wanna say I appreciate the devs don’t give any pay to win options in the game. Some of the tasks are annoying and the maps need balancing I think. Other than that I think the gameplay is the strongest aspect of this game as it preys on our natural suspicions of others and that’s an amazing concept for strangers and friends to play. The biggest problem I’ve had though, and the reason for the 3 star rating is due to the fact that I can hardly even get matches when I want to. I get error messages often saying I was dropped from the server or that the matchmaker is full. As someone who has put money into this game I find this unacceptable. I understand the rare server issue here and there but when it takes over 20 minutes to search for game I feel like I’m literally wasting time. This game was the number one ranked action game at one point and there are ads at the end of every match. Surely the devs need to work out a better deal with their current sponsors.

For example, every task around the house goes from costing one star to two. The rewards aren’t sufficient to the amount of boosts being spent on harder levels. Some levels are so hard and waste so many lives that you have to use boosts just to get through it. There should be more levels that don’t take multiple tries to get through. Some of the tasks that the game makes you do are stupid. The game is trying to get you to use all your stars so you have to play more, which is typical, but with the levels so hard, it’s really just a tactic to get people to spend more money. It’s also takes way too long for the lives to reload. It’s like 25mins per life. I really liked this game at the start but the further I’ve gotten, the less I want to continue playing. Instead of throwing in so many different aspects into the puzzle games so soon, they should have waited and made it harder much later. I’m only in the kitchen and I spend on average 3-5 lives on each level. I try not to use boosters because they are so hard to earn. Paying 900coins to get 5 more moves on one level, when each level earns you roughly 50-70 coins (hard levels earn you 100+) is just sad. In conclusion, this game only remains fun for the first 60 levels then gets frustrating.

I have not found a way to fix this, because even when I try to enable cellular data, it still will not load because no changes in settings are saved before the game crashes. This is extremely inconvenient when I just want to play single player offline. This bug has been going on for months and is consistently overlooked. Please fix this immediately. It discourages players from even attempting to load up their worlds, which ultimately hurts the developers.2) Background music stops when Minecraft is launched. If you are listening to Spotify/Pandora, etc, then the game automatically cuts off your music when you listen to the game. If people didn’t pause their music before entering the game, then obviously, they want to listen to it while the play! This was definitely programmed in, for reasons I can’t even begin to comprehend.

Something that I find very annoying, is when your in the middle of playing, then get kicked out and it says: “Sent 6 pings” or the “unreliable packet source” or something. Its really annoying how you can be playing and then boom. Back to the main menu you go! So that’s something I would like if you fixed it. And finally, the trolls.

To my mind, there aren’t many ads, they do pop up across the home screen occasionally, but you can X out of those easy enough. The other ads are for rewards, which makes it worth it. The actual game is neat. I like the power ups you can get in game, ESPECIALLY the mystery hoverboard. I wish it’d appear more often. It’s really cool to be able to test out the different powers. If I had to change something, I’d want to make an in game option where if you’re ready to leave the game but don’t want to click exit or forcefully run into a train, this will be the option for you. Occasionally in the game, there are already stairs or ramps or whatever going sideways, so it’s be cool to be able to leave that way. Once you take the stairs, ideally there’d be a short escape scene, maybe with a mystery box or something, just because it’d have to be a bit tough to actually get in the stairway or whatever the exit is. It could be a special event/mission! I hope you take this suggestion seriously, because it’d be AWESOME!!!",I wish it’d appear more often.,5,True,general,positive,5

Each update is better then the last, adding amazing animals and new objects. However I have noticed in the recent update, TONS of new bugs and issues have occurred. Such as, sometimes when I am crafting something, I craft it and then go back in the crafting table. But my item is still there. I try to remove it, but it just replaces itself with another one. I end having to close the app and reopen it. Another problem that has recently developed is, whenever I go into chat when I am on a sever, my game immediately freezes, then crashes and knocks me out of the app. Another thing that has recently happened is when I am playing and go into my inventory, it freezes and won’t unfreeze. One more is, sometimes when I go into the nether, it stays frozen on the “loading terrain” screen. Other than these glitches and bugs, I HIGHLY recommend this game. Whenever I want to play a fun game, this will always be my first choice. With the endless building ideas, the challenge of defeating the bosses, and playing countless games and tests Minecraft is the best game out there and will make you play for hours. A few animal ideas are:Bears, birds, snakes, frogs, mice, sharks, squirrel, elephant, lion, monkey, butterfly, crab, deer, penguin, kangaroo, koala, raccoon, alligator or crocodile and more types of dogs.Thank you for reading!","Ok, I have been playing Minecraft for years.",5,True,enjoyability,positive,4

Now let’s talk about cheating... now sometimes there is people who are on discord with each other or at each other houses or something like that but every time that I get Imposter then they know that it’s me most of the time because if there on discord or something like that then they can tell each other if they are a Crew mate or an Imposter and if i’m the Imposter and they tell each other what they are over discord or something like that then they know that it’s me because they know what each other are and they are like “well if we are all Crew Mate the he has to be and Imposter” and that is an easy win for them especially easy if we have 4 or less people in the game... but other then that I really have no other complaints... like overall it’s a pretty good game and I love the new update and stuff like that sooooooo yeah.",So I like this game a lot and I  think that it’s petty fun and addicting.,4,True,enjoyability,positive,4

This game has characters from all over the world, and even characters that are make believe or just not real.

The graphics, gameplay, and everything overall is amazing! I was also thinking of some things that could be added. This is something I heard on the internet and isn’t original, but I wanted to spread it around because it sounds interesting. What if there was a role called “Jester” where their goal is to get ejected, making them win? Sounds like it could be a hit or miss, but I think that’d be cool. Also a role of “Detective” sounds interesting. Like, you can give that person the option to take screenshots, so they can have solid alibis/evidence of the imposter, but only they have it, so that the crew mates don’t have too much of an advantage. They can send the screenshots to the chat, helping out their case (maybe also a limited amount of screenshots so their not overpowered?). Also the idea of adding friends would be cool! It’s sad you can’t add anyone, and the strangers you could enjoy playing with you’ll only play with once. It would also be nice to adopt mini crew mates whenever their parent dies, I just think that would be very wholesome. More colors would also be cool, I mean, this is only optional since the colors that are already there are great, but I think it’s something to keep in mind. But overall, fantastic game!

For example: I start up free play and see an option saying “would you like to turn on intelligent mode?” I turn it on and free play starts. It has usual free play features like picking tasks and being the impostor. But with one major difference: the AI is more intelligent. I’ll give you a look at both sides of this mode. CREWMATE VIEW:You run around doing tasks with the other AI crew mates. And one of the crew mates is the impostor. The impostor’s AI does intelligent stuff like: trapping you in rooms, sabotaging electricity and such, and so much more! IMPOSTOR VIEW:The crew mates are doing tasks. While your the impostor. You take down the AI crew mates and such. But the AI crew mates does intelligent things like the AI impostor. Like:Reporting dead bodies, calling emergency meetings, and so much more! I would love to see all of this added into free play mode. I will be awaiting your response.EDIT:Ok, I think a great feature to have would be when the impostor kills you and your pet cries, you can comfort it.

However I did find more cons than pros. Let’s start off with finding a server. You have three different maps to choose from. You can also choose if you want to play with 1, 2, or 3 imposters. The imposter’s job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with “Confirm Ejects” and “Visual Tasks” on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says “(insert anything here) was not An Imposter” or “was An Imposter”. With it being the imposter’s job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! This game is ruled by immature 12 year olds and when they get accused, they break lose. I am not exaggerating, I have heard the N word, the F word, and so many other ridiculously bad and racist words in this game than I did in the real world. The N word is a word that you will encounter. People think it’s okay if they leave the hard r out but it’s not. The N word is probably the most popular word in this game.

First of all, when I’m on the main screen on the game, I’m about to click the screen to start playing, but the is always and add that pops up and I always click it. This has happened several times and it has been frustrating. Another thing is that when new characters are invited into the game, they are always super expensive. Sometimes the characters can be up to $2.99 in real money or a whole heck of a lot in game money. I never really get anything on subway surfers but one time I had saved all my money for Tasha, one of the characters. She was about 30,000 coins. Later on I looked on the app and a new character was in, and was 100,000. Although there are some bugs in the game, it is very fun and I defiantly recommend getting it.","She was about 30,000 coins.",4,True,cost,positive,1

Absolutely horrible. Anytime I add an AI in the game, whether I’m playing with other real players or just a lobby of computers, the AI is seemingly always rolling favorably. It’s obvious that the computer players cheat via the dice roll. There have been countless games that both me and my brothers have played where the AI player outlasts us because it gets favorable rolls. Even when a whole side of color schemes has been bought up and houses/hotels applied, they always seem to skip over those spaces until the game comes down to human player and AI. This is one of the most frustrating things I’ve ever encountered on a cell phone game because I’m an avid monopoly player and I’m well aware that the dice doesn’t favor anybody at anytime. The math or algorithm behind the dice roll needs to be addressed before I can enjoy this game. COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY unless you have people around you and can play locally. Also the game has horrible issues with it disconnecting, and the AI makes you miss out on deals or rolls.

So if you get a new phone, you are basically starting from scratch, with hardly and characters, boards or character outfits and tokens, money, keys, hover boards, and perks like headstarts and score boosters.

Me in contrary, is landing on every single one of their and gets all the chance cards which make me pay more. The chance cards they land on gives them money no matter what in the endgame.

I think it would be best if instead of the gaming forcing you to use an option based on the date of birth that you put, you have both options in the settings of the game and parents can choose the options for their younger children that way the older people playing can use the option that allows them to talk how they usually would ( before the update) without the quick chat only.

I feel like you should really add a friend system! That way you can send friend requests to people you would like to join’s game.

Also when people say inappropriate things like private things to other strangers. It gets me disgusted. So I thought something thst could help with that is banning.

That type of gameplay is so small & almost insignificant that it’s pretty shady for them to put that at the forefront of their advertising. If you had to pay upfront for this game, I’m pretty sure there would be grounds for a lawsuit; it’s THAT bad. What this game is centered on is the much more generic Candy Crush, “match the tiles” type gameplay. The reason I don’t give it a 1-star is because they have actually made this generic premise fun, and put some admirable twists into the formula (at least I think. I don’t play many mobile games and especially match tile types). Interesting challenges, creative power-ups you can make if you’re smart, genuinely challenging puzzles (in a fun way), admirable special effects & sound design. Doesn’t SEEM to try to force its way into your wallet (from the 12hrs I’ve put into the game thus far) in terms of gameplay, but it does do plenty of in-game marketing.If this game was honest about what it really was, I’d give it 4-stars.

For a half of a year, practically nothing was added. If you cannot maintain the game properly, then you should sell it to a company that can. Third is the community. Although the developers cannot control this, it still makes the game a bad experience for many players. You may have added what I am about to say already, but if you didn’t, you should add a age restriction. There are a lot of people that play Among Us who are not very smart and accuse people for no reason and everybody listens without any evidence.

However I did find more cons than pros. Let’s start off with finding a server. You have three different maps to choose from. You can also choose if you want to play with 1, 2, or 3 imposters. The imposter’s job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with “Confirm Ejects” and “Visual Tasks” on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says “(insert anything here) was not An Imposter” or “was An Imposter”. With it being the imposter’s job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! This game is ruled by immature 12 year olds and when they get accused, they break lose. I am not exaggerating, I have heard the N word, the F word, and so many other ridiculously bad and racist words in this game than I did in the real world. The N word is a word that you will encounter. People think it’s okay if they leave the hard r out but it’s not. The N word is probably the most popular word in this game. I could go on and on but these are the main reasons why I gave it one star","The imposter’s job is to sabotage, kill and lie.",1,True,enjoyability,positive,4

Would be nice to see the city in 3D more often during gameplay. The “your turn” banner obstructs the dice momentarily. The dice should never be obstructed. When adding houses to the purple properties, the add houses button extends over the purple properties making it difficult to add properties there. I find myself accidentally not buying a property because the buy or not buy buttons are too close together. Maybe a different layout for buying properties. For games against the computer it would be nice to limit the number of times the computer offers a trade. It gets to the point where it is offering trades on every dice roll which slows the game down. For the custom rule set, having an option to start the game with more money would be nice. The EA version of this game had a terrific animation for the game pieces. Would be nice to see the something similar here.",Would be nice to see the something similar here.,4,True,general,positive,5

So here's what happened: I was playing Subway Surfers for most of the day, during car rides and stuff, whenever I had a little free time. But on this day I just couldn't die. I used over 80 hoverboards, 1 key and amassed over 4000 coins and a wrecking 3 million score. This was done over a accumulated time of two hours. It was awesome. But I had to go to sleep. I left the app open with my phone charging and went to bed. The next morning, I went straight to my phone, unlocked it, and since it was left on Subway Surfers, it went to Subway Surfers.  Here is where I know most people would be incredibly angry; this is a 3-million-2-hour-score, you know? Instead of going to the ""paused"" part, the app RESTARTED!!! I could've thrown my phone, thrown chairs or whatever, but here I am writing a review. I haven't played the app since, and here's additional information: So I also have the game 2048. Even if you restart the app, restart your phone, or your phone dies, your progress WOULD NEVER BE LOST!!! EVER! Why can Subway Surfers be like that?

But I don’t like how we have to do stupid tasks like “call someone” for up to 6 stars!! We don’t get enough coins for winning levels! Also when you get into the game more, it takes so much longer to finish a day, it’ll be like 6% closer to rewards when you win a level. Also I don’t like how we only have five lives. I feel like we should have more lives than only 5! The game’s really fun but there is some stupidity to it like tasks cost so much, but u only get one star for each level, and for every normal level, 50 coins. But if you want more moves after you use them all up, it costs 900 coins. I think that is way too expensive. And I hate how long it takes for lives to refill! Like, 30 minutes to wait for one live! Also, for the harder levels, I think that we should get more stars, not only one!! I think that if they’re going to go all the way and say that it’s a “super hard level” then they should act like it and give more stars once the level is completed!!

There are 2 that really stick out. The first one starts once you get to about 100k score, but gets more prevalent once you get to about 250k. What it happens is, when you jump from the ramp up onto the train, and land on the train, you stay floating, and it won’t let you jump or roll, once you go to the left or right, it’s fixed though. That doesn’t mean it’s fine though, because if you don’t notice it, it might kill you. The second, and worse of the two comes down to the hit-boxes. This just happened to me right before writing this review. On top of the trains, sometimes you just want to go left or right, but when you try, you stumble into nothing. That just happened to me... two trains in a row and it got me killed. Luckily I had just started the round and it seems to happen in the early stages most often so at least it’s hard to ruin your high score with that glitch, but that one is much more annoying because you can’t avoid it. There are a few others that aren’t as bad, for example, earlier I had super sneakers on and went into a jet pack, paused the game for a bit, then I started running in the air with the jet pack on. I also have screen recordings of the first glitch and this one. Please get these fixed ASAP!!!!","On top of the trains, sometimes you just want to go left or right, but when you try, you stumble into nothing.",4,True,enjoyability,positive,4

The ads mostly show the lead character, Austin the Butler, in a sticky situation and the player has to pull levers to get him out of it. The actual game, however, is mostly improving the large house owned by Austin’s parents.  The sticky situations are called “Austin’s Bad Dream and in 35 levels, I have only been able to see a few of them.  The game is mostly playing a form of Candy Crush to earn stars in order to improve the home. That part is not so bad. The music is pleasant and the game is a relaxing time waster, at least initially. I don’t mind using the earned stars to replace furniture or a rug, but as the game goes on, you have to use the stars to do just about anything like answering the door, unpacking a TV, or even starting a new day. And once you’re out of stars, you can’t do anything else until you have won more candy crush games and earned more stars. You earn one star from winning each candy crush game no matter how difficult the game is. Win in one round, earn one star. Win after 20 rounds, earn one star. The idea of course is to get the player to purchase items to play longer. I get it. Most games I have seen do the same thing, but they don’t ramp up the difficulty so quickly.","And once you’re out of stars, you can’t do anything else until you have won more candy crush games and earned more stars.",3,True,cost,negative,1

Every day of every round I have to keep on pressing a X. Like STOP. Another thing is that the power ups are so short! They only last like five seconds. I think they could fix that in one of there updates. Oh speaking of updates, I love how they change the setting, but why CHANGE your high score. Like seriously! Come on man. My high score was like 80,000. Well HIGHER! They completely reset my high score. At first I was confused because I was proud of my high score, and trying to beat it, but then IT GOT RESET!

Not to mention the coins, you only get at max about 100 coins depending on what level you beat, but if you want extra moves it 900 coins!!! Ok, you do the math.... when it’s all said and done you have to spend money on extra lives to beat the boards, on coins to advance in the levels and get the stars you need in order to fix things to advance!  As the boards get harder we should get more stars, Hard=2 stars, Super Hard=3 stars and so forth, as we advance in the game tasks cost more stars so we should naturally EARN more stars to off set it!  Not keep us at 1 star per level, but the higher we go tasks are costing us 6-12 stars PER TASK, come on!! Same with the coins!

As a huge fan of interior design, this seemed like the perfect game for me. I got to play fun levels, but also simultaneously get to decorate a home. However, after spending months on this game, and completing 240 levels, I've only just now unlocked the 3rd room. If you can even call it that. It goes living room, kitchen, and then garden? Why!? There are TONS of rooms in this house, and after TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTY levels, I'm decorating a garden while so much of the house is untouched.

Third, some of the options in the older version aren’t in the newer one like removing those animations, slight of hand, starting allowance, starting properties, etc.  Fourth, it’s pretty obvious whose turn it is, so I don’t need an obnoxious banner across the screen before every freaking turn!  Finally, the main reason I got this version was because I was hoping the trade AI would get better, but not really. It got slightly better when doing a human to computer trade, but the computer to computer trades are pathetic. It’s like they all gang up to get monopolies so the human can’t get one. I haven’t tried online, and I won’t because I can’t in good conscience ask someone to buy this garbage. If I could get a refund, I absolutely would. It’s already deleted and I will never install it again.","(Frankly, they were annoying in the old version, too) They are in the way so I can’t see the right side of the board.",1,True,efficiency,negative,3

The game is fun and requires lots of skill or just fast fingers. My only problems are the prices of some of the items. For the characters I think they can get a little bit pricey. When you get a mystery box it can give you items that help you unlock characters. I honestly think that it might take a month or almost a year to reach the amount because I’m not joking, they are really pricey. Unless you playing it nonstop without taking your eyes off the screen then it might take a few weeks. But that’s still a while. Also the hover boards. They can also get a little pricey. And why buy something that you can only use in certain times. It makes it worse that they can get really expensive. Honestly I think their pretty cool but please lower the prices. The last thing you might need to fix is the add lag. Sometimes it will start freezing up and you have to restart the app and that’s a little annoying in my opinion. I also think that you should only have to face adds if your getting something for free. Other than those issues I truly love the game! Sorry I couldn’t give it a 5, but I will if you fix the issues 🥺. Keep making great games!",Sometimes it will start freezing up and you have to restart the app and that’s a little annoying in my opinion.,4,True,efficiency,negative,3

That was before level 1913. I liked it because I could always advance. Beating difficult levels may have taken MULTIPLE attempts but didn’t require having to spend money. However, within the game there are weekly contests where you’re placed on teams. The better you do the higher your team level placement. When you’re ranked in the lower levels I’m convinced this game randomly “loosens up” and you’re able to go on winning streaks (doing so allows you to accumulate coins to help Austin fix the house, which is the point of the game, right?). Likewise, I’m convinced when you do well and find yourself in a higher level, the game “tightens up” and it’s impossible to win any level without spending coin, either real or earned. When I got to level 1913 I got placed in the highest ranking level. Since then I have not been able to get, even close, to beating a level without earning enough extra coins (by watching ads, etc.) to buy my way through. It takes a looooong time to earn those coins!  Relaxing and fun not so much anymore...","However, within the game there are weekly contests where you’re placed on teams.",5,True,enjoyability,positive,4

It’s fun but it totally clickbait me on Instagram with the little games that I haven’t seen once after downloading. I’ve gotten so frustrated so many times I had to stop playing for a couple of days because the levels get so hard you need god to help you and not boosters. Sometimes the normal levels are harder than the hard ones. Not only that but you start by collecting 1 star per game to having to pass multiple levels for one task, which can take 3 stars per task when it used to be 1 Star per task. And I hate when you’re remodeling a room and at of nowhere something happens in another room you have to fix. Like, everything is supposed to be new, why are they making me waste my stars on a room I had already finished ? And 5 lives isn’t enough! Either give me more lives or make them take less than 30 minutes each to reload. Oh and lastly if you’re getting a gift for infinite time let us choose when we can use it. I shouldn’t have to waste it because I had work or class. Sometimes you can’t play for 2 hours at that very second.

Subway Surfers by Killow is just the app to get.  To start with I like all the powerups.  A powerup is a thing that you can get that can help you get more coins.  I like the jetpack powerup because it gives you lots of coins without the police officer chasing you.  I also like the magnet power up because you can get all the coins for a couple seconds without crashing. I also like how you can get keys.  Keys are things that are hard to get but you can get a lot of stuff with them like outfits and hoverboards.  For example, you can get characters with them.  I also like how you can get keys by doing stuff like getting 810 coins in one run you can get 8 keys.  Last of all, I like how you can watch videos to get things.  For example, you can watch a video every day to get two keys and you can also get super mystery boxes by watching videos too.  Last, I like  if you are at 0 coins or 0 keys, you can watch videos nonstop and get 10 keys in 15 minutes or get 10,000 coins in 20 minutes.  As you can see this is a very good game.  Go on your devices and buy it now.","Last of all, I like how you can watch videos to get things.",5,True,effectiveness,positive,2

It has changed so much and suddenly blew up out of know where! I have been creating boat racing maps, and almost everything I can imagine. If you can imagine it build it, not only does it show how creative you can be but also make you get more ideas, it’s almost an addictive cycle. Weird I know I took a break from this game for a year and then boom out of no where blew up.  I would always love to think back to 2011 to when I enjoyed this game on an old pc at my grandparents. Now I can’t stop playing it. All I can say is thank you, bringing us entertainment for all these years. This game has been there sense the start and came out rough into the best sandbox game I have ever played. Sure there are some negatives about the game, like you can’t get custom skins off files on Xbox without having to decrepit the games files. I always had used MCPE skin creator/editor and it worked amazingly but sad to know I can only do it on mobile. But put that aside, and you have an overall 90/10 game right now for me it’s perfect as it is. Sadly the original creators of Minecraft are gone and now bough by another company, if your reading this you might say, the new company is bad. But what they did to the game is so amazing, doing more than the original game designers would to with it.

Minecraft is one of the best games out there at least for me it is. I basically grew up playing it on my xbox 360. Nothing wrong with the gameplay or anything. But I do have one complaint. Now i’m not entirely sure if this a bug or a glitch so it might be nothing but it bothers me. So basically I play on the server: MineVille City. And when i go into one the minigames, that minigame being High-School Roleplay there are problems with my custom skin. So idk if this has to do with the server but this has happened most of the time. I walk around and when i pull up the pause menu my custom skin is replaced with a random skin. And I sometimes see other players with my skin equipped. And idk if my skin is working or not. Even when i do the inventory menu my custom skin is still there. So Mojang, if you see this then please reach out to me. My Minecraft account is a Xbox live account named Endermen21YT. So please if you can, look into this. Now this could totally just be the server or something else so this might not even be happening. I’ve even noticed that this has happened to other ppl before on those servers. And it only happens when I enter the minigame. In the main server my skin’s fine. So anyway yeah that’s all. I personally still love this game to freaking pieces so keep up the good work Mojang.","So please if you can, look into this.",5,True,general,negative,5

I have been on the same level for going on four days and have already spent almost $10 in AppStore micro transactions attempting to just get past this one level and yes like you would’ve guessed all those coins were gone within five minutes of purchasing and I was still stuck on the same level after spending $10. All in all this is one of those games that works more towards advertising, getting the game out there, and setting everything up to bring in the consumers and then has all these dead ends barely a day Into the game that in some way or another require you to watch advertisements for their financial gain and make micro transactions in their game.

I often keep my tablet in monochrome setting and for the most part this doesn’t inhibit game play as the shapes are so different. However the ice bombs are all the same shape and in grayscale I cannot tell them apart as they are too close in tone to their one another and not identical in tone to the matching shape. It is frustrating.On a completely different note. I am convinced Austin is dead and this whole game is an afterlife experience. Otherwise the back story of him as a butler (second generation no less) whose family as this fabulous history and mansion makes very little sense. The butler conceit causes other problems as well. I HATE having to spend stars to sweep or dust when Austin sweeps to “alienate boredom,” and often enough to warrant concerns about it being an obsessive behavior... maybe he isn’t dead, maybe his parents sent him to a special program for individuals with extreme obsessive behavior, the Institute wasn’t a school for butlers, it was an institution for individuals with special needs such as delusional thinking and obsessive behavior.",I enjoy this game but as I have progressed I have run into a major problem with the ice bombs.,4,True,efficiency,negative,3

Just when I thought I was finished in the garden, the story line STILL has more garden tasks. I really want to see more of the mansion! My daughter played this game as well and mostly stopped playing when the garden renovation began because she wanted to renovate the home. I can see how those with less patience would easily give up if they want home renovation instead of the garden. I'm on level 454 and have only renovated the butlers room, great room, kitchen, and stairs! Maybe the creators of the game could give players a choice on which room or area to continue with?

Then I landed on chance and received the same card as the first guy “Advance token to Boardwalk”. Now when I was a young boy I was told you’re supposed to put your card in another pile and shuffle them when they are all used up. Or you can keep them in rotation and place the card at the bottom.

Or I assume they quit the game because the game will just stop. They won’t roll, make a trade, or put houses down. The game is at a standstill and I have no idea why. There needs to be some sort of timer for everything so that way the game can keep moving or if someone doesn’t make any moves for a long period of time or purposely leaves the game they should go bankrupt and their properties should either get auctioned off or return back to the board for the other people to buy in the future. It’s super annoying having to leave a game because nobody is moving or being sore losers. I don’t have any interest in playing this game anymore because of this.

What if there was a role called “Jester” where their goal is to get ejected, making them win? Sounds like it could be a hit or miss, but I think that’d be cool. Also a role of “Detective” sounds interesting. Like, you can give that person the option to take screenshots, so they can have solid alibis/evidence of the imposter, but only they have it, so that the crew mates don’t have too much of an advantage. They can send the screenshots to the chat, helping out their case (maybe also a limited amount of screenshots so their not overpowered?). Also the idea of adding friends would be cool! It’s sad you can’t add anyone, and the strangers you could enjoy playing with you’ll only play with once. It would also be nice to adopt mini crew mates whenever their parent dies, I just think that would be very wholesome.

It took me almost 3 weeks of playing for about 45 minutes a day to get the hoverboard that I wanted.

I’m obsessed with hardcore survival through never ending creative builds. I love the nether and the end. I hope the end gets updated but that is not what I am here for. 1st of, I want to make a whole new type of Minecraft world called service.This would be a pre-server world so that you can put the build in there into a server without the whole “24 7 hour update that I waste my day on.” 2nd, I want to make a new land called “the fade.” This area would be all faded. But it wasn’t always that way...if you find and defeat the forden (A small mob that is is visible but will fade if you look at it.) If you find the power source that causes this mob to fade you cow destroy it. That mob will drop something called the Fax enchantment to gloves (which y’all should add too) and you touch something the whole world will spring with life. Then a door will appear out of no where to take you back to the over world when you are ready. This will also contain Force oars and on and on. 3rd, A time traveler. If you kill a wither, enderdragon, and forden, they will drop something called Broken map. If you place the three pieces together it will unlock something called a time traveler. This can take you to places from When those shipwrecks weren’t shipwrecks to when the villagers actually LIKED diamonds.

This game takes the struggle out of someone having to be banker. A game dragging on for 10+hrs and people are always online playing. There were a few kinks with it in the beginning. But I am seeing that they are fixing it now. I am only giving it 4 stars because as of late a lot of the games I have been in the middle of playing will just not be able to resume. It will be someone else’s turn and they just never come out of their turn. I think their should be a time limit once they have handled they business. Otherwise you have to wait until they “end turn” & this creates problems in the game. My games were all lost and needed to be exited after this occurred and all that I worked for or played for was lost. This creates a waste of time. Which is pretty unfortunate but other than that this game is extremely fun. I purchased both the other boards the snow and the 1930’s board I love all of them. Wish the tokens were a bit cheaper and more options. Overall few bug fixes and this game is going to remain my favorite.

Like for example, having the game players find LIMITED EDITION Gold boxes along the trail, that are filled with SUPER RARE things like unlocking special characters or getting a BIG amount of gems or coins. Other than these few suggestions, this game is amazingly fun!

There should be a way to kick people faster if you’re the host during a game. Some people like to call emergency meetings and waste time, so being able to kick them out would make it go by way faster. 2. I think it would be awesome to add a send a friend request button. Some people have really good friendships on here and a lot of the time one of them might disconnect or have to go and never see each other again! ;( If we had a add friend button, we could always play with them. Plus, when you try to give your personal number or social media’s out to someone, the whole server can see it unless you ban them all. 3. I think I saw this on another review, but maybe add a limit to camera time? It’s kinda hard to kill when people are guarding the cameras. 4.

With Gardenscapes it seems like I'm not able to complete and able to upgrade or rebuild anything as quickly as I seem to be able to with Homescapes. So if you wanted to change something with Gardenscapes that would be one thing.  I guess it's a little harder to complete a level. You can't mix two explosives like you can with Homescapes. It's just totally different with the match game with Homescapes it seems to me. I love it and I can't get enough of it. I'm always wondering what the next level is going to be like. I recommend Homescapes to everyone who likes to play games like this to take a break from your every day Life. Very enjoyable.,I love it and I can't get enough of it.,5,True,general,positive,5

Board games in reality are fixed in many ways. For example, a deck of cards with a discard pile ensured that every card in the game will be played before a player can draw a second copy of any card. This also ensures equal odds of getting a card. This app takes the simpler approach of randomly generating the card on each draw. This means you may draw cards like “Speeding Fine” two or three times in a row, while never pulling “Advance To...” cards of any kind. The odds of card drawing seem to also favor the weaker cards. The developers assure that’s not true, but an easy way to restore faith would be to have the cards work with an actual deck and discard system instead of random generation upon each draw. To me, the purpose of this is to mimic the board game, if you wanted to change the fundamentals of the game then a different game mode would be nice. A “Randomized” mode could be fun along with the original two, but I would want the “Classic” mode to run like the classic board game. Otherwise, the game is functionally okay. Some cards do not work as intended, like cards that require paying between players, but most major bugs have been worked out. TL/DRThe old app was much better",Board games in reality are fixed in many ways.,2,True,general,positive,5

However, I am confident that the game will continue to be hashed out in the coming months and eventually will fix the bugs and add more features.The amount of games that are completed before some kind of bug freezes up the game is very slim. This is unfortunate for a game that requires a decent time investment to complete. I also find myself wondering what happens when a player decides to quit. Is that why the game freezes? Are they replaced with an AI? If so, why doesn’t it tell me that I’m playing AI? Is the game freezing from and idle player? If so, can there be a boot timer? Are people rewarded for finishing games? Are people penalized for not finishing games? It would be great to have some kind of stat collection that keeps track of your wins and matches you up with similarly skilled players.There are a lot of features such as described above that can be found in the Settlers of Catan app that I think would be very beneficial to Monopoly.","If so, why doesn’t it tell me that I’m playing AI?",4,True,efficiency,negative,3

The game is fun and requires lots of skill or just fast fingers. My only problems are the prices of some of the items. For the characters I think they can get a little bit pricey. When you get a mystery box it can give you items that help you unlock characters. I honestly think that it might take a month or almost a year to reach the amount because I’m not joking, they are really pricey. Unless you playing it nonstop without taking your eyes off the screen then it might take a few weeks. But that’s still a while. Also the hover boards. They can also get a little pricey. And why buy something that you can only use in certain times. It makes it worse that they can get really expensive. Honestly I think their pretty cool but please lower the prices. The last thing you might need to fix is the add lag. Sometimes it will start freezing up and you have to restart the app and that’s a little annoying in my opinion. I also think that you should only have to face adds if your getting something for free. Other than those issues I truly love the game!

And I gotta say, this game nails the classic murder mystery game vibe. Considering how easy it is to pick up and go, you can really play it whenever you want, which is awesome in on itself, but it only makes it even better is how it’s free on mobile, is so nice, and it’s one of the main reasons it got popular in the first place, almost anyone with a phone could get the game! Sure, the advertisements can be a bit annoying, but that is really a small hiccup in the game, and besides, a free game has to have some kind of advertisements to keep it alive, so it’s hardly even a problem. The only real issue I had with this game was connection issues, but again, the game overall kinda shadows out the issues. The tasks/mini games are probably one of the best parts about this game, each one feels fun to do, especially if you can get a rhythm for each task. And the fact that you can have small meetings to decide who they think the murderer/imposter is, is GENIUS. This makes the game run at a good pace, makes replay ability amazing, and overall a amazing game. So innersloth, I’m excited for the updates and ideas you have for this game in the future!

I personally was over the top crazy for it and loved it, but it’s now dead for many reasons. One reason is hackers and cheaters. More mods are being used and hacking and cheating is getting more popular. Some times, I can’t play one game without a hacker or cheater. Multiple people play together and say who is the imposter and some hackers are being able to kill in the middle of meetings and do visuals as imposter. Another reason is that there are no new maps. Among us said that the new airship would come out in early December 2020, but they delayed it and said early 2021. Everyone thought it would come out in January or February, but it’s March and it still hasn’t come out yet. Another reason is that the new chat update can’t let you talk freely. Now you spend all of  your meeting time searching around for the prewritten text that you want to say. Another reason is the horrible connection. Some times, I have to spend like 20 minutes trying to connect my game. People say it’s my bad wifi, but that’s not true because my wifi works perfectly fine.

I mean, it doesn’t even have a part where you can ask for people to watch you do a visual! I also feel like since people can lie about their age, and it isn’t fair to us as kids to let older people be able to say what they want when it seems like they do the most cursing, maybe people can report others that cuss so they would have to use the quick chat for a month or so, since another problem is that it only stops the kids from cursing and explicit stuff, they can still see what other people do if they don’t have censor chat on.

The concept and game idea itself is why people enjoy playing so much. The game allows you to work to deceive and lie to people in a way that is totally expectable socially because it’s all for sun and games. It’s the same game over and over and over again yet you still have people returning to play more which really says something about how great it is. I could play like 20 games in a row and never get bored. A lot of people feel this same way which is probably why the game is so successful and although that’s good, it comes with a price. That price is more content. People need more and more content and if the demand isn’t met with even small additions like new tasks or new colors for characters then the game will slowly start to die out. A big thing people want is the ability to have friends. You can play like 40 games with the same person and really bond with them and get to know them, only for both of you to be kicked out of the game for an update or hacking or something and you’d never be able to see them again. A friend request feature would go a long way to helping this issue, plus with more friends you can play with, the more people will want to play.All in all this is the best game in the App Store right now 10/10, 100%, 5 stars, it’s just great.","All in all this is the best game in the App Store right now 10/10, 100%, 5 stars, it’s just great.",5,True,general,positive,5

However, I would really like to see some better incentives to keep players in the game. For some of the side challenges (e.g. knitting), the rewards, such as unlimited lives for a certain period of time, are given immediately. If I had the option to save that reward for a rainy day, perhaps when I’m tackling a particularly difficult level, I’d be more inclined to play for longer periods of time. When this happens, however, it’s almost always the case that I don’t have the time to actually use said reward and it ends up being useless. I’d also like to see the coin rewards have a better balance. 50-70 coins as a reward for each level won? Come on! What about an additional ten or so coins for each remaining turn? Say if I’ve beaten a level and I have five turns left. I should win the base coins of fifty and then an additional fifty for each turn I didn’t use. For harder levels, base coins of 100 and then an additional fifty coins for each additional remaining turn. Now THAT’S an incentive! That would be rad. Otherwise, fun game!",I should win the base coins of fifty and then an additional fifty for each turn I didn’t use.,4,True,general,positive,5

I mean, it doesn’t even have a part where you can ask for people to watch you do a visual! I also feel like since people can lie about their age, and it isn’t fair to us as kids to let older people be able to say what they want when it seems like they do the most cursing, maybe people can report others that cuss so they would have to use the quick chat for a month or so, since another problem is that it only stops the kids from cursing and explicit stuff, they can still see what other people do if they don’t have censor chat on.

Two really cool characters I would LOVE to have you guys bring back is Mimi and Rabbot. I missed both of them and couldn’t get a chance to have them as characters. Speaking of Mimi, if I’m correct she does have a pet otter which is super cute. I don’t know if the otter runs with her when she is trying to evade the inspector, but if it does I think that the Subway Surfers team should have a pet isle where players can choose an animal to run with them like the inspector has a dog. I would absolutely DIE if that could happen. I also definitely think that younger players would enjoy this. Please consider because I think it will definitely draw more attention to this amazing game. Besides that I think this game has amazing graphics and deserves to have “hype” I also like how you guys make different maps that represent different parts of the world.

I’ve been playing it since I was 8 years old, and it’s come a long way since then. Most games I play I usually play them for about a month or two, three at the most, and then forget about it. But Minecraft is different. It’s stuck with me for a long time now (almost 6 years). It’s a great game to play with friends and family, whether you want to create a massive structure or survive in the wilderness while fighting monsters, or do a bit of both. However, like every game, it does need some improvements. First of all, I suggest that it have a wider variety of animals in the game, (elephants, lions, tigers, sharks, etc). Also, I think their should be more options of furniture, especially in creative mode, rather than having to use steps as chairs. There are also a few glitches that can be annoying. For example, if you add to many mobs in creative, it will lag out your game. Also, there was this one time that I had to delete and reinstall the game because it wouldn’t let me open up the game.

So, first off I would like to start this review off with talking about how much I love this game. I downloaded this game years ago and still love it. It’s ultimately a great game. Here’s some of my requests you should do. First off, could you guys please make the game where you don’t need wifi to be able to join people? It always makes road trips boring for me if I want to play minecraft with a friend. Also, if you guys could make it where people can share a wolf. My first wolf from the beginning passed away tonight due to a skeleton attack. Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone’s been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful. Also if you could make it where villagers, foxes, and mobs can be leashed. That’s all my requests for now. Thank you!",That’s all my requests for now.,5,True,general,positive,5

But I have suggestions, can you add a friending thing? Like where you can friend people so u to it can play with them again. Like if you know the person in real life or if you liked playing with them! I also really think you should at least have one pet for free, the mini Crewmate is like and icon for the game, but then you download it and found out you have to pay to get it. Thanks you reading this and I would recommend this game for anyone, even if these suggestions don’t happen!After Update:The update is, well, weird. The cameras on Polus have glitches all over them so when some walks on camera there is a million copies of them and on some areas, two different camera sections collide and look very weird. The chat, I like that you have the quick chat, but I really don’t like that we still can’t just type. It’s so hard to find what you want to say and by the time you find it, everyone has already voted. Also on the Polus map, the names do disappear, but I kinda like it because you can hide. Another thing on the Polus map, the lava is gone, I see the bubbles still but the actual lava is not there. One last thing, when I am a ghost, I sometimes like to go outside of the map, but I noticed that now there is no wall keeping me from going away too far, can you please bring that wall back? Thanks!","It’s so hard to find what you want to say and by the time you find it, everyone has already voted.",5,True,learnability,negative,6

I thought I was making the mistakes but nope every game it happens SEVERAL times. Roll a five & it will go 6 to land you on someone’s hotel...incredibly frustrating.  The game is also very predictable. If you build properties the next roll the next player almost every time won't land on you. I like the game, however another issue is that it freezes up at crucial junctures of the game. Such as after a trade. You have no choice after several minutes to abandon the game. Very frustrating after vesting so much time into it. Also I just finished a game & I bankrupted every player then it announced the last bankrupted player as the “winner!”. Ticks you off especially after spending an hour with idiots that want to make the same trade every single turn! I almost quit several times but I hung in there and put up with it because the other normal player suffering through the BS like I was. The game definitely needs some improvements. I would give this 3-1/2 stars but it won’t let me. PLEASE FIX THE FREEZE UP PROBLEM! CONSTANT CONNECTION PROBLEMS TOO! I check my internet & it’s connected. And all my other devices are working.",Roll a five & it will go 6 to land you on someone’s hotel...incredibly frustrating.,2,True,cost,negative,1

BUUUUT having said that, I have become so addicted to this game, checking in on it several times a day and can’t wait for my lives to regenerate and LOVE it when I finally win a particularly difficult level. I do wish that the rewards were a little more generous. And that things didn’t cost so much gold I mean 900 for only 5 more moves! That just kills my stash! But I keep playing so 🤷🏼‍♀️It kills me to admit that I have spent money to buy more gold coins in order to keep playing or buy more boosts, and to buy the gold is $5.99 which even though i paid for it I feel is a bit steep. I wish that more of the gold you win for beating each level went to you instead of into your piggy bank, that is very frustrating!! But here I am still playing. I might have to delete it to spare my own piggy bank. ***I finally had to delete it*** I refuse to throw away any more money on something so frivolous but kept getting stuck on these ridiculously hard levels with no helps and not enough gold to buy any more. :( they really need to lower the cost of things and give you more gold when you win a level. I play Toon Blast now and love it have not needed to spend money the rewards I get for playing are enough to keep going and it’s so fun!",I do wish that the rewards were a little more generous.,2,True,cost,negative,1

Whenever we introduced something into the house one person always says something negative about it and we end up abandoning it. Yesterday when I purchased this game, I had to entice the whole family to even get together to play this game. When I finally succeed in doing so we tried out the accent card list and we immediately all agreed this was the best game ever! This game really brought our family together after 3 years of complete utter boredom! Thank you!

But recently the game was updated so that anyone under the age of 18 can not type what they want or need to say. I see that they were trying to fix the problem of swearing and online dating but it just wasn’t the right way to fix the problem. The game used to be so enjoyable, and now I probably won’t be playing it again. There are many other ways to fix this problem, but restricting what people can type so that they can’t get their point across is not the way to do it. If this was removed I definitely would give it a 5 star review, but unfortunately this update has ruined the game for me, my friends and my family.EDIT: I won’t be playing the game again I’ve tried to get over the update but I can’t. To be honest you ruined your own game. The bulk of people that play are teens and now we have no freedom. We get all of these restrictions everywhere and you had to add among to that list. I’m very disappointed. If you could lower the age for safe chat from 18 to 13 that would be great. 18 is very unrealistic compared to 13 which is much more reasonable. Also look at all of the reviews your getting. People aren’t happy and your star level is dropping. I’ll let that speak for itself. Just change the game back or tweak the update please. I also just deleted the app. I have no patience for things like this. Please fix the app!!!!! 😡😡😡",People aren’t happy and your star level is dropping.,1,True,enjoyability,negative,4

The game somehow logged me out of my Microsoft account, and i don't remember the email for it. Though the email part is my fault, Why did it sign me out? Since i cant find anything, ill just delete the app.Update: i have gotten the purchase from my previous review, but now it isn't working again. Whenever i buy something, the purchase goes through but i don't get any coins! I will call and Apple store and/or the Microsoft store to ask to fix this. If you have any response or any information before i do that, please tell me developer(s).Before i get to the complaint, i just want to say that this game is very fun. The game looks really cool, even without any texture packs or really anything from the shop. Thats ehat I have a problem with though, or really more my most recent minecoin purchase. I wanted to get a texture pack, Simply Cubed, and it was about $4 worth of minecoins. I bought it, and i accidentally pressed my home button. I went back on, and the game crashed, but that usually happens when i do that. I went back on but i didnt have it. I tried again, and it said that my purchase was free since i already bought it. I didnt have it though. I tried again, but still no. Ill edit if i get it back.","Thats ehat I have a problem with though, or really more my most recent minecoin purchase.",1,True,cost,negative,1

First, i wanna say that the game’s interface is very well designed. It’s like playing the actual game on another level. Second, i like how we have the option to play the QUICK mode since this game is naturally takes forever (which is nice somehow) to end. Third and on the bad side, i wish there is a way for an actual chat rather than the pre wording that is not even applicable for every scenario. EG, if trading cards, reasoning for trades or refuse etc. that would be like the actual game and that will add the excitement in playing. Also, themes, boards, and tokens are way expensive. Would be nice since the game itself is paid, features should be lesser the price and not higher than the actual game. Lastly, on that note i wish there is an option to add the player as a friend for future game. That will actually make the experience more real rather than it’s always random guest and while playing with random people, you can’t add any of those players per say. Overall nice game. Worth the money. But these improvements will make it more fun to play the game.","First, i wanna say that the game’s interface is very well designed.",4,True,efficiency,positive,3

I love this game, I’m obsessed, I play all the time and I love it!The concept is great! Ten or so people, most are crewmates, who are supposed to fix the ship and keep an eye on things. A couple, however, are imposters and they are supposed to kill all the crewmates while pretending to be one of them. Its a great game. The concept works great! There are so many strategies to use and its so open ended even with rules in place.But however, the new update may have just ruined things for me. Don’t get me wrong, the quick chat was a good idea, but it doesn’t work as well as you would think. First off, its missing some crucial phrases and questions. Its like impossible to now ask for proof or evidence. If someone doesn’t give it, you can’t get it cause you can’t ask “Proof?” or “Why?”. You also can’t really question people as easily. This makes it very limiting. That wouldn’t be as much of a problem if you could use the free chat too, but now you can’t. As of the update, you cannot use the free chat if you are under 18. This basically ruins the game for all kids. The free chat is good, but not by itself. It extremely limits what you can say and how you get info. It just does not work. Please fix this InnerSloth. Other than that, its a great game!",This basically ruins the game for all kids.,3,True,general,positive,5

It got to the point where I can accurately predict my rolls. If I own 80% of the board, they will only land on the other 20% and that happens 100% of the time. The computer makes trades amongst themselves that aren’t fair, they’re only helping each other get sets to knock you out of the game. If you have hotels, the AI WILL NOT LAND ON THEM. Only between your hotels. It’s laughable at how predictable it is. If a 6 will land you on their hotel, you will roll that 6. I had a property of every color in my last game to ensure no one can build, so what happens? Yup, I land on their railroads only. So what do I do? I buy one of their railroads for a ridiculous price. The next turn, the computer acquired a railroad from another computer to re up the price. I know what you are thinking, why wouldn’t they buy that railroad prior so that they had all 4? Nah, only when I take the railroad away are they ALL OF A SUDDEN interested. It’s insanity how much they fix the games in favor of the computer. I have no clue why, we’ve already paid for the game, but they do. It’s painfully obvious. You’re welcome for the money I spent.","If you have hotels, the AI WILL NOT LAND ON THEM.",1,True,general,negative,5

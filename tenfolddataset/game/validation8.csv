It is so easy to use, and the 4 dollars that I paid for it was so worth it! This beats any other Monopoly app that I have used BY FAR. It lets you get all the same Monopoly experiences as the board game, such as auctions, but the game is way faster! Also, there are absolutely NO ads! It lets you customize the game rules, too! For example, you can change the number of houses you need to have on a property before you can buy a hotel. My favorite thing about this game is the hassle-free games! Just tap a few buttons, and BOOM! You‚Äôre playing Monopoly! There‚Äôs no organizing money, or dealing with cards, It‚Äôs just SO EASY!!!! I mean, if I could, I would give this game 10 STARS!!!!!! Another great thing about this game is that it saves your games! For example, if you start a game but then you run out of time, you can exit the game and when you open it back up your game is still there.

It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre begging for money which makes the whole game seem like a huge advertisement. Another problem I have with is with the whole ‚Äúsubway surfers‚Äù theme. Every download the only thing that changes are a new map, which is basically the same layout as every other map, and an overpriced character. Maybe you can add some more interesting updates like a railway crossing with another train intersecting like a cross and the player has to jump through a hole in one of the cars. Or maybe a car crossroad where the cars are driving over the track and the player has to jump on the cars. How about a more interesting above-ground section when you use the jetpack so you can dodge different objects such as trees and parked bicycles. This game has major potential, and even though it has been out for quite a while, not many things about the maps and overall layout changed, which is very disappointing.

Second, the animations are so annoying!  (Frankly, they were annoying in the old version, too) They are in the way so I can‚Äôt see the right side of the board. They are too long and they don‚Äôt get shorter when you play a quick game. Third, some of the options in the older version aren‚Äôt in the newer one like removing those animations, slight of hand, starting allowance, starting properties, etc.  Fourth, it‚Äôs pretty obvious whose turn it is, so I don‚Äôt need an obnoxious banner across the screen before every freaking turn!  Finally, the main reason I got this version was because I was hoping the trade AI would get better, but not really. It got slightly better when doing a human to computer trade, but the computer to computer trades are pathetic. It‚Äôs like they all gang up to get monopolies so the human can‚Äôt get one.

I love this game! The idea is classic, like mafia but in space. It can be technically called a brain game because the idea of lying and deceiving your ‚Äúteam‚Äù is very cool way to stretch your detective skills. Personally, this game is really fun! I wouldn‚Äôt give this game anything below 5 stars! But, there are a lot of things that concern me a little to. First, the over usage of bad words and #. It‚Äôs pretty hard to find a game where no one is constantly cussing inappropriate things in the chat, which ruins the game for everyone! On the other hand, there are some ridiculous hashtags marked on a word that isn‚Äôt even bad! Some people also put very disgusting things as their names. Another thing I would like to suggest is adding friends! Me and my friend just started playing together yesterday but it was very hard to get her into the same game as I am. Sometimes it‚Äôs very boring if we start a new game as host and no one‚Äôs joining! I think it would be nice to friend request and then we can request our friends to be able to join the public server we are in! It would save a ton of time. Other than these complaints I absolutely love this app. If you are the creator, please keep doing what you do!","On the other hand, there are some ridiculous hashtags marked on a word that isn‚Äôt even bad!",5,True,general,negative,5

I personally was over the top crazy for it and loved it, but it‚Äôs now dead for many reasons. One reason is hackers and cheaters. More mods are being used and hacking and cheating is getting more popular. Some times, I can‚Äôt play one game without a hacker or cheater. Multiple people play together and say who is the imposter and some hackers are being able to kill in the middle of meetings and do visuals as imposter. Another reason is that there are no new maps. Among us said that the new airship would come out in early December 2020, but they delayed it and said early 2021. Everyone thought it would come out in January or February, but it‚Äôs March and it still hasn‚Äôt come out yet. Another reason is that the new chat update can‚Äôt let you talk freely. Now you spend all of  your meeting time searching around for the prewritten text that you want to say. Another reason is the horrible connection. Some times, I have to spend like 20 minutes trying to connect my game. People say it‚Äôs my bad wifi, but that‚Äôs not true because my wifi works perfectly fine. The last reason is that some people change settings so that either the crew or the imposters have an almost certain win. If you are reading this long review, then I thank you for your time. If you are reading this and are from inner sloth, then hopefully you will consider doing something to revive among us.","People say it‚Äôs my bad wifi, but that‚Äôs not true because my wifi works perfectly fine.",2,True,general,positive,5

I enjoy playing this with my friends, we all have a good time! Although you don‚Äôt know people you play with in random servers it‚Äôs fun playing with them to. So like I was explaining how the game is a fun experience there is also some issues I have with it. One being the hackers (you probably did something about that already, my bad if you already did) and lots and of glitches. I always get kicked out of the game due to an error or some weird glitch. I also have a problem with some of the people in the game treat it as if it‚Äôs tinder and flirt with people in the game. I know there‚Äôs probably no fixing that but it kinda gets annoying being for them to be like that. Also, I think you should make like a friend thing where like you can befriend people in the game and they can send you ( or you send them) friend request and when either of you accept then you can chat with them and join the same game as them so you don‚Äôt have to go through like hundreds of other servers to see them again. And for the last, it would be nice to add Charles to the stickmin bundle (this isn‚Äôt really a problem but it would be cool to have him in UwUüíû).

It‚Äôs pretty bad when you start a match with no moves and it has to reshuffle. Power ups can be hit or miss at the start. Towards the higher levels you‚Äôll start off with a very small section and you‚Äôll have to open the rest of the field but you‚Äôll end up wasting 3 or 4 moves before you can even do that. Some levels seem impossible to beat without the RNG gods giving you tons of power ups. You‚Äôll often lose by 1 move which prompts you to use coins to buy 5 more moves. If you don‚Äôt have the coins, that‚Äôs when they hit you with the pay to win aspect of it. As many other people have said, it often feels like the game is working against you maliciously so you‚Äôll be forced to buy more coins or power ups. It gets extremely frustrating playing the same level thirty times and losing by 1 move over and over. This is the same for both gardenscapes and homescapes (and probably the other games by the same developers). Bottom lines is you can pretty much tell by mid match if you‚Äôre going to beat the level or not. If you still have 75% of the objectives to complete and you‚Äôve been forced to waste 3 or 4 moves in a row and you have less than 10 moves left, you‚Äôre not gonna win. I usually just quit and start over at that point.

When we would ask what did you do for the weekend Amoung us would be a popular game they all played. After a while, I found myself wanting to play the game more and more. I downloaded the app and found myself loving it! The game was relatively easy to play, and fun. While, I enjoyed the game their were still some downsides. One of the major cons was the gaming community in the app. People can have offensive name, and bully people without getting kicked out of the game. Many of the hosts do not seem bothered by this,  and don‚Äôt even think to ban or kick these people from the game.  As time went by I found the game less entertaining and it became boring. Even with the different maps, which I have tried; all the game is finish task look off suspicion and repeat. I really thought it be more of a challenge. It is challenging in its own way though, like collaboration with people. It can be hard to reason with people. For the reasons above , I quite the game.

There are a few problems though. To name a few, when you use an ad to revive, sometimes you will respawn you end up in an area where you are supposed to be on top of a train, so all 3 lanes have trains coming at you just to kill you again and the only way to survive is to waste a board so you can crash into a train. Also, parts of the game don‚Äôt make sense. For example, you‚Äôll jump over a barrier and then you‚Äôll see a train going down the same lane where the barrier is just to run over it. Trains will also appear out of nowhere. Keys are another huge problem. They are so rare to find and then if you don‚Äôt want to watch an ad to revive, you have to pay at least one key.

Me and my friends love playing servers together and being able to friend other users could make it easier to game together. Also a microphone feature would be great. Chatting with the other users whilst playing out loud could be really great, because you‚Äôd be talking instead of typing through a screen. You‚Äôd be able to pick a game with microphone chatting or without, just whatever you prefer personally. Also being to branch out into private chats with people in the server would be really good. That way you could discuss plans with fellow imposters and win in a better and more strategized way. Also you could chat with friends you‚Äôre playing with separately. It would add a better feature of strategy and even betrayal to the game. You could even use it for persuasion purposes.

Before the update was released, people were chatting very easily on the game and I, including others, had no problem with the chat before hand. Ever since the update was released, there is always little no none chatting when discussing who the imposter might be. Also, a way to make this less of a problem is to give people the option to not use the new chat so they could type what they want. This option can give people the chance to communicate better with others. Also, the restrictions on what you can type in the chat like ‚ÄúAdmin‚Äù can lead to others thinking you were in Admin but that was where the murder was, not where you were. Discussing who the imposter is a pain because you basically have no clue who the imposter might be because no one uses the new chat. This game has become quite boring because of the update and I think it would have done just fine without the new update. The chat was what kept the game fun and entertaining but now the restrictions of what you can say in chat have taken all the fun out of the game. I have recently deleted the app because of this.

However, the game is hard to play on my own time. The game really only works when it wants to. Some are do to bugs, and some are due to just poor design. 1) Game will not load when you go offline still logged into Xbox. It will not let you sign out, and the game crashes repeatedly. I have not found a way to fix this, because even when I try to enable cellular data, it still will not load because no changes in settings are saved before the game crashes. This is extremely inconvenient when I just want to play single player offline. This bug has been going on for months and is consistently overlooked. Please fix this immediately. It discourages players from even attempting to load up their worlds, which ultimately hurts the developers.2) Background music stops when Minecraft is launched. If you are listening to Spotify/Pandora, etc, then the game automatically cuts off your music when you listen to the game. If people didn‚Äôt pause their music before entering the game, then obviously, they want to listen to it while the play!

Just an interesting spin to make the game a little more addictive.  The little side quests like trophy challenges and the parrot gifts are super helpful. However I will say sometimes you are gifted 30 min unlimited game play and you don‚Äôt really have an option of when to use it. So if I am getting in a quick game on a break or before dinner and I am gifted one of those it goes to waste if I can‚Äôt continue to play for an extra 30 min.  Not going to lie, at those moments It really is frustrating because you get only 5 lives and the regeneration rate is slow. In addition the buy rate for items feels a little high. As an example to buy an extra 5 moves at the end of a tough level is 900 coins. You maybe get 55 coins for beating a level. So you have to tear through 18 levels to earn enough to buy that extension.  It actually de-incentivizes me to buy a package because it never really feels like you are getting a deal.  That being said if you can play and not get frustrated when you get stuck on a level for days, or are willing to pay for buy ups this game rocks.","Not going to lie, at those moments It really is frustrating because you get only 5 lives and the regeneration rate is slow.",4,True,learnability,negative,6

It happens way too often. 2 when playing multiple computer opponents, if the first computer player on the list of players on the right side of the screen goes bankrupt, you can no longer purpose a deal with the other remaining opponent. It defaults to try to make a trade with the bankrupted player with no option to change it to the other player, so the only way to trade is to wait for the computer to strike a trade with you and then counter the trade. 3 when you get a card that says each player pays $10 for a birthday or whatever, the money never comes out of the players account. Maybe that‚Äôs because of the free parking rule. Not sure. 4 if you use up all of the houses so that there aren‚Äôt any more in reserve, and then sell a hotel, more houses Automatically appear.

His parents, as empty-nesters, have decided to sell their large estate and move into a smaller, more efficient home - better suited for their needs and season of life. Well Austin, being obviously wiser than they, immediately moves back into his parent‚Äôs house and convinces his aging parents to not only stay living in an enormous mansion they can‚Äôt possibly keep up with, but to spare no expense at fixing the monolith up. If that part of the story doesn‚Äôt fry your bacon, then be prepared for pointless  tasks designed to eat up the stars you earn on activities NOT RELATED to repairing the old mansion and the rooms within. The levels require very little strategy; I find the board layout to be purely based on luck and it can take several days or even weeks to beat one, so earning stars to get ahead will truly enslave you to this game. As for the characters; Austin is the know-it-all son, his father a dim-witted buffoon, and his mother has no personality. His relationship with Katherine is uninteresting and ALL other characters are one-dimensional stereotypes. So if any or all of those things appeal to you, download the game.

Also, if you get a really good medal, like the diamond, you don't get to keep it for the next week because it changes depending on where you are that week. Another problem is the keys. To revive yourself, you have to pay more and more each time, until it gets so expensive that you can't even afford it. The only way to get keys is in the run, in mystery boxes, or in awards, which is a huge problem because: you only find a key in a run about every eighteen games or so, and if you miss it, then you don't have a chance to get another one. It is extremely rare to get a key in a mystery box, and when you do, it's only one, which can't even begin to pay for the expenses of reviving yourself.

But the inconsistency on the dice roll for all players is a predictable algorithm with no actual randomness. When I pay $4 I don‚Äôt except the world but I would have liked the opportunity to earn thru winning, other boards and pieces. No leaderboard or way to keep stats in this digital world was a surprise. I‚Äôm hoping for change as my thoughts seem to be repeated over and over again in the reviews. I‚Äôd love to be able to get my friends involved but most would be upset paying for something with some of the missing options.

It is so addicting and I love playing it with my friends. I would 100% recommend this game. I would give it 5 stars, however there are three things I would love to see added. The first one is a friends system because it would be a lot easier to join a friend‚Äôs game if you could just click ‚Äòjoin game‚Äô like in roblox. A second thing I would love to see added is a currency like coins or maybe something more creative like aliens. Then, players should receive say, 5 aliens or coins if they win as a crew mate and 10 aliens or coins if they win as imposter. Then, I think players should be able to use these coins/aliens to buy hats or outfits. I also think it would be really cool if we could use this currency to buy higher imposter chances because I would love if I could do that. The third and final thing I would love to see added is a report button. This would be good because I have noticed that some people say weird or disturbing things in my games quite often. I know the creators can‚Äôt control what people say, but it would be nice if they could be reported for it. Overall, I love among us but I would love to see these three things added. P.S.

For some reason the AI just so happens to just the correct numbers to avoid my hotels/2-4 houses...for like 6 rotations to the board... they literally almost never land on my properties when there is only one AI left.  Me in contrary, is landing on every single one of their and gets all the chance cards which make me pay more. The chance cards they land on gives them money no matter what in the endgame.

Enemies do not make unique sounds when hit and has a seemingly stock sound effect playing. I have not had problem with infinite maps before; however, I now have problems with all maps. The game only feels playable when all high end settings are disabled, mob spawning is disabled, and setting gameplay to peaceful. In addition, the UI is not touch screen friendly like it was in the alpha and beta. I know that I am using old hardware but this many problems for a game that ran otherwise smoothly in the past is ridiculous. One final criticism is that unlike the alpha and beta there are only two rendering options that make the hot bar look pointless: 5 and 6.

I love the dolphins and turtles but couldn‚Äôt they add a few more like perhaps turkey or peacocks. I know you can easily get mods for these things but some cost money.

Like maybe they could have huskies pugs Pomeranians Shibas Chiwawas and Great Danes these are all great dog breeds. They could have which dog you get by the color of the wolf you tame like huskies would be white wolfs and Great Danes could be brown wolfs.

My family thinks I‚Äôm insane and I shouldn‚Äôt play it as much as I do, but it‚Äôs my go to game when I‚Äôm bored. But, I recently had some trouble yesterday. So I was saving up for all five of the Christmas people, and I finally got 100 keys, so I got it and then left the app. Then I went back in it later and it said I had 93 keys... I was super confused, so I went into the me section where my boards and characters are to see if I still had my Christmas people, but I accidentally bought a character. And I also had the Christmas people too. After being way too confused I got out for the day. Then, this morning i went on to get my daily snowflakes and words and it wouldn‚Äôt let me watch an ad when I died. I had to use keys. Now, I still had 30-something, but if I continued like that, with the amount of time I spend on the game, those keys would be gone super soon. So, if anyone can help me or tell me what happened, that would be great, thanks.

I don't want to stop playing but I run out of lives so I have no choice. Lol. I think I like it better than Gardenscapes and I love Gardenscapes too.  I like how you can put different types of explosives together or two of the same to make a bigger explosive. It would be even greater if you could put more than two together. I've had three explosives lined together but I can't mix all three together. I haven't had 4 or more alined but that would be more awesome. With Gardenscapes it seems like I'm not able to complete and able to upgrade or rebuild anything as quickly as I seem to be able to with Homescapes. So if you wanted to change something with Gardenscapes that would be one thing.  I guess it's a little harder to complete a level. You can't mix two explosives like you can with Homescapes. It's just totally different with the match game with Homescapes it seems to me. I love it and I can't get enough of it. I'm always wondering what the next level is going to be like.

I‚Äôve tried to be patient and play the games out without spending money, but many levels you just can‚Äôt! I don‚Äôt mind spending the money here and there, but it‚Äôs so expensive, it doesn‚Äôt even make it worth it. You get 1000 coins for .99 and it takes 900 coins to get 5 extra turns.

I first saw it played on Twitch and said I have got to experience this. The graphics, animation and modeling are really fun. Based on old reviews, I think many issues from the past are solved. The network seems reliable and the rules and variations are pretty much on point. The AI players add a new dimension. They are annoying at worst and a wonderful addition for shrewd dealing humans, at best. The klunky repetitious and nonsensical ‚Äúoffers‚Äù they make are pretty bad. And the fact that they only assess deals based on value of the deeds and classifying them as ‚Äúeasy, medium, or hard‚Äù just improves their luck and reduces yours makes them pretty frustrating at times. But they‚Äôre fun to push around and like I said, they create a whole new dimension in game play. Imagine making a deal with a predictable robot to mess up your human opponent, etc. That said, the overall game feels cold and lonely.

Subway Surfers by Killow is just the app to get.  To start with I like all the powerups.  A powerup is a thing that you can get that can help you get more coins.  I like the jetpack powerup because it gives you lots of coins without the police officer chasing you.  I also like the magnet power up because you can get all the coins for a couple seconds without crashing. I also like how you can get keys.  Keys are things that are hard to get but you can get a lot of stuff with them like outfits and hoverboards.  For example, you can get characters with them.  I also like how you can get keys by doing stuff like getting 810 coins in one run you can get 8 keys.  Last of all, I like how you can watch videos to get things.  For example, you can watch a video every day to get two keys and you can also get super mystery boxes by watching videos too.  Last, I like  if you are at 0 coins or 0 keys, you can watch videos nonstop and get 10 keys in 15 minutes or get 10,000 coins in 20 minutes.  As you can see this is a very good game.

Real players wouldn‚Äôt do half of this stuff   Sometimes it appears that the dice roll is not random.  Sometimes the chance or community chest cards can be the same thing on back to back draws. Who goes first, second, third is flawed because it depends upon how you are listed and who rolls the highest dice when playing against the A.I players.   Not as much animation is needed which may help the battery drain or at least give an option to turn some of that off. So many things in each turn slow the whole game down and could be altered to keep it moving. Why not put the property cards displaying in the lower right rather than taking up the whole screen.

The amount of coins that are needed to buy things like boosters and lives are crazy high. 900 coins for 5more moves on a level is crazy and then if you want to do it again, it‚Äôs 1200! When you only win between 50 and 100 coins ( on a really good round) it takes a really long time to recoup. They are very stingy with giving you boosters and chances to get more coins. I play other games that are very generous with coins and boosters which allows me to play and enjoy the game. Isn‚Äôt that what the game should be all about? Challenging levels are one thing, but when it takes so many lives to win a level it‚Äôs not fun anymore. I won 2 hours, played constantly for that time and only made it through 2 levels.

Currently, there are bugs that prevent games from being finished, and these bugs can happen after you‚Äôve played for 30 minutes or more. For example, if somebody owes money, and they try to make another deal to raise more money, this seems to stop the game. It seems to lose track of whose turn it is (and who is still owed money). Sometimes, if someone refuses all your deals for that turn, it ends your turn for some reason, but the End Turn button is still shown. Pressing End Turn at this point stops the game. If you are low on battery life and get a battery warning, it can disconnect you from the game. Also, players sometimes stop playing, and there‚Äôs no warning or way to resign without stopping the game for everyone. In spite of these flaws, it‚Äôs a fun game, but there‚Äôs room for improvement. Personally, I‚Äôm waiting for these issues to get addressed before investing more money in a Season Pass.",Pressing End Turn at this point stops the game.,3,True,learnability,negative,6

I love this game, I‚Äôm obsessed, I play all the time and I love it!The concept is great! Ten or so people, most are crewmates, who are supposed to fix the ship and keep an eye on things. A couple, however, are imposters and they are supposed to kill all the crewmates while pretending to be one of them. Its a great game. The concept works great! There are so many strategies to use and its so open ended even with rules in place.But however, the new update may have just ruined things for me. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the quick chat was a good idea, but it doesn‚Äôt work as well as you would think. First off, its missing some crucial phrases and questions. Its like impossible to now ask for proof or evidence. If someone doesn‚Äôt give it, you can‚Äôt get it cause you can‚Äôt ask ‚ÄúProof?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù. You also can‚Äôt really question people as easily. This makes it very limiting. That wouldn‚Äôt be as much of a problem if you could use the free chat too, but now you can‚Äôt. As of the update, you cannot use the free chat if you are under 18. This basically ruins the game for all kids. The free chat is good, but not by itself. It extremely limits what you can say and how you get info. It just does not work. Please fix this InnerSloth.

Then it kicks me out and says ‚ÄúThis server is full‚Äù I know you probably cannot stop this from happening. But I have no one else to talk to so I only have you guys.Update: Oh! And I forgot, sometimes people make servers and people join, only to get kicked or blocked by the host. I don‚Äôt understand why people do this. What do they get out of it you ask? Nothing. Can you please make a limit of how many people you can kick? Or perhaps rules I am sincerely sorry if this problem has been fixed. But I haven‚Äôt seen it with my own eyes happen to ME, but I‚Äôve seen it happen to others.Update: I‚Äôve now discovered that the ‚ÄúAutomatic role‚Äù system is very bad for me. I‚Äôve gotten Crewmate almost all of the time. Now it‚Äôs rare if I even get imposter ONCE. I try every single day. But now it‚Äôs a very boring app for me since all I get is Crewmate and always get killed first, then have to deal with dumb people who see the body but just stand by it without reporting, then another person comes in and thinks it that person since they‚Äôre standing near the body.",I don‚Äôt understand why people do this.,5,True,learnability,negative,6

The main thing that made my review so low, is the amount of effort it takes to play with other players. Everyone has to have the same version, and the only simple way to join someone's local server is if you are connected to the same WiFi. If you aren't, you MUST sign into Minecraft using your X-Box account, which for a while I didn't have. Now that I have signed in though. I'm now finding out that I have to pay for realms, the add friends, and play with them.

It is fun and easy to learn how to play, and it kills time while making us think. I believe the new tournaments are fun, but it needs more. The levels need to make it so more coins can be earned. If I earn the minimum coins per level (50) and play 10 levels, it still isn‚Äôt enough to get a retry on a particularly hard level. Now I do think the fact they are called ‚ÄúHard Levels‚Äù makes it better for us to prepare, and definitely the coin amount there is worth it. But in order to pass a level, I spend almost 6-8 hearts if it‚Äôs extremely time-consuming and hard. There is still the issue with more prizes. I like the daily bonus, but after the seventh day, it sent me right back to the first day without any prizes. I believe it should be after the 7th day, you get all the prizes from day 1-6 at the same time, and then day 8 and on should have more until you reach every seventh day again. It‚Äôs a good way to make people play the game. There also need to be more tournaments that don‚Äôt give prizes based off places. I never get first place in the plane tournament, but in the knitting ball one, I got a lot of prizes and it made me feel more encouraged to try. This game is great but definitely needs more to attract more and lose less people.","Now I do think the fact they are called ‚ÄúHard Levels‚Äù makes it better for us to prepare, and definitely the coin amount there is worth it.",4,True,efficiency,positive,3

Speaking of Mimi, if I‚Äôm correct she does have a pet otter which is super cute.

But whilst this game is structured beautifully and an incredible game, I do have a few small tips that I think could make this game better than it already is. First of all, an add friend button. Me and my friends love playing servers together and being able to friend other users could make it easier to game together. Also a microphone feature would be great. Chatting with the other users whilst playing out loud could be really great, because you‚Äôd be talking instead of typing through a screen. You‚Äôd be able to pick a game with microphone chatting or without, just whatever you prefer personally. Also being to branch out into private chats with people in the server would be really good. That way you could discuss plans with fellow imposters and win in a better and more strategized way. Also you could chat with friends you‚Äôre playing with separately. It would add a better feature of strategy and even betrayal to the game. You could even use it for persuasion purposes.

The game rarely glitched and overall was the best mobile game I‚Äôd found in a while. But after this last update I can‚Äôt say that anymore. I love the idea of not showing who voted who ( it really helps with the occasional bullies) and I like the point of the update. Next I will say what I would like you to add adding friends, maybe more maps ( I like the ones you have but a big Change like that sound good), no hacking ( it‚Äôs still happening just not the full game bug you guys had), and actual bug fixes. Let me explain the last one or why I can‚Äôt say I love the game anymore. Earlier today I was playing with my younger sister and teaching her to play, sounds fun right? Well it was but soon after we had to make a new game bc people weren‚Äôt able to stay on our game with being kicked off for no reason. So me and her tried making a new game and it basically told us we had been M.I.A when the game hadn‚Äôt even loaded yet. Then we gave up. Later that day i by myself tried playing a game and it kept telling me I have an old version of the game even tho it just updated a day before. So that brings us to now. Pease actually do bug fixes and please read this and take note of how your game is extremely glitchy and isn‚Äôt a fun game anymore. Thank you very much for reading.",Let me explain the last one or why I can‚Äôt say I love the game anymore.,3,True,general,positive,5

Clearing account data, restarting my device, nothing worked. My Minecraft just kept crashing.I can‚Äôt believe the developers managed to overlook a thing that is literally CRUCIAL to Minecraft, it‚Äôs single player ability.

How hard is it to make sure that Xbox live isn‚Äôt glitchy, doesn‚Äôt CRASH every time you open the app without wifi. Yet with this disgustingly glitchy Xbox live sign in and sign out if you‚Äôre still signed in you can‚Äôt even play without WiFi. How awful. Plus the world I was trying to get into didn‚Äôt even have Xbox achievements. So fantastic job, just fantastic. Now I have to sign in, sign out every time I get WiFi.

It is very entertaining and sometimes I spend hours in a day playing it. The levels seem to get really difficult after you start renovating the third room. I really find it so frustrating that we have to wait 30 minutes for each life to come back. Also, the amount of moves given in each level is ridiculous. Sometimes, you need just 2 more moves to pass the level and you can‚Äôt because you‚Äôre out of moves. Then, if you want more, you have to pay 900 coins for only five more moves. And if you don‚Äôt have the money, you have to forfeit and loose the game. Other times, you can join competitions and get really cool power ups. If I get stuck on one of the levels in the challenges, I loose all my prizes and earned money. The point of the game is to be fun and decorate a house, which honestly is my favorite part of the game. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the matching part of the game is so fun too, I just hate the fact that you have to wait so long to get lives and some of the tasks they ask you to do are just ridiculous. As an example, if I got a cat in the game, it says I need to give a star just to name it. I mean that‚Äôs ridiculous.

So like I was explaining how the game is a fun experience there is also some issues I have with it. One being the hackers (you probably did something about that already, my bad if you already did) and lots and of glitches. I always get kicked out of the game due to an error or some weird glitch. I also have a problem with some of the people in the game treat it as if it‚Äôs tinder and flirt with people in the game. I know there‚Äôs probably no fixing that but it kinda gets annoying being for them to be like that. Also, I think you should make like a friend thing where like you can befriend people in the game and they can send you ( or you send them) friend request and when either of you accept then you can chat with them and join the same game as them so you don‚Äôt have to go through like hundreds of other servers to see them again. And for the last, it would be nice to add Charles to the stickmin bundle (this isn‚Äôt really a problem but it would be cool to have him in UwUüíû).

A friend of mine can no longer even load the game to play our world together. It's upsetting. It's truly upsetting. The game lags and my world's so corrupted entire chunks glitch out. I don't like it anymore. And no company should ever send out an update that they know has problems they have to acknowledge in the update notice. That's just uncalled for. I'm really upset with the direction the game's going and a lot of people are claiming to be having these problems. I don't want my world to be messed up forever. I don't want to lose this game, but I can not only bear to stand to play it, I literally can't keep it open with this update. Get it together.

But recently the game was updated so that anyone under the age of 18 can not type what they want or need to say. I see that they were trying to fix the problem of swearing and online dating but it just wasn‚Äôt the right way to fix the problem. The game used to be so enjoyable, and now I probably won‚Äôt be playing it again. There are many other ways to fix this problem, but restricting what people can type so that they can‚Äôt get their point across is not the way to do it. If this was removed I definitely would give it a 5 star review, but unfortunately this update has ruined the game for me, my friends and my family.EDIT: I won‚Äôt be playing the game again I‚Äôve tried to get over the update but I can‚Äôt. To be honest you ruined your own game. The bulk of people that play are teens and now we have no freedom. We get all of these restrictions everywhere and you had to add among to that list. I‚Äôm very disappointed. If you could lower the age for safe chat from 18 to 13 that would be great. 18 is very unrealistic compared to 13 which is much more reasonable. Also look at all of the reviews your getting. People aren‚Äôt happy and your star level is dropping. I‚Äôll let that speak for itself. Just change the game back or tweak the update please.

It‚Äôs obvious that the computer players cheat via the dice roll. There have been countless games that both me and my brothers have played where the AI player outlasts us because it gets favorable rolls. Even when a whole side of color schemes has been bought up and houses/hotels applied, they always seem to skip over those spaces until the game comes down to human player and AI. This is one of the most frustrating things I‚Äôve ever encountered on a cell phone game because I‚Äôm an avid monopoly player and I‚Äôm well aware that the dice doesn‚Äôt favor anybody at anytime. The math or algorithm behind the dice roll needs to be addressed before I can enjoy this game. COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY unless you have people around you and can play locally.

I like how you can put different types of explosives together or two of the same to make a bigger explosive. It would be even greater if you could put more than two together. I've had three explosives lined together but I can't mix all three together. I haven't had 4 or more alined but that would be more awesome. With Gardenscapes it seems like I'm not able to complete and able to upgrade or rebuild anything as quickly as I seem to be able to with Homescapes. So if you wanted to change something with Gardenscapes that would be one thing.  I guess it's a little harder to complete a level. You can't mix two explosives like you can with Homescapes. It's just totally different with the match game with Homescapes it seems to me. I love it and I can't get enough of it. I'm always wondering what the next level is going to be like.

But then the new update with the new chat feature and when I could ONLY use that it became very annoying for me to actually look for what I have to say, and it took too long, then people started thinking that I self report... it‚Äôs better off really that I should just say directly what I saw is my personal preference. So what I did is actually re download my game and lie my age to be older to get past that problem, and it worked from then, now the new update with the new airship which I like the new map, however I am still navigating everything before I play any online games with it. I did the same thingwith the age thing, and it didn‚Äôt give me a choice for the chat. So communication is getting very hard for me, as I heard the same from others before this. So my point is just because of that, makes the game a lot harder and less fun. I sometimes have conversations in the lobby, and it‚Äôs fun, but without that humor expressed or something that sounds like your own words makes the game less fun and sound like a bot.

When you join ‚ÄúOnline Multiplayer‚Äù, and you‚Äôre playing, you can leave the app and come back however long later, and the game would continue from where you left off. This is the first evidence of AI in an online supposed real person mode. The second bit of evidence is that the AI trades at very specific rates: when you‚Äôre paying cash for a property, they want double the property price. If you offer too much lower than double, they‚Äôll permanently reject the offer. Closer to double, and they‚Äôll counter for double. Third bit of evidence is when they offer you a trade, and you decline. If they offered money, they‚Äôll make another offer increasing their offer by 10$. Decline again, they‚Äôll increase by 10$ again. And so on. Another issue is that on Multiplayer with friends, if you accidentally leave the app, you‚Äôre instantly replaced with an AI and there‚Äôs no way for you to rejoin. This makes your phone unusable other than to play the game if you don‚Äôt want to erase all the progress you‚Äôve just made on a match with a friend. Please look into this.

These issues are so constant that it makes me not want to play anymore, and I‚Äôve talked to many others that feel the same way. Just because everyone loves the game doesn‚Äôt mean people won‚Äôt start hating it because of the big persistent issues we all face multiple times in one sitting. I would really love to see this game work at peak performance, but at this rate I have no faith that will actually happen.

Although, I see a lot of negative feedback, I 100% disagree. To explain the complaints about how hard it is to beat people who are in gold/diamond, they have worked hard to get to where they are. So, yes it may be a little challenging to beat them but that‚Äôs not the games fault. I believe this game is one of the best games out there. Especially because the game is culture friendly. This game has characters from all over the world, and even characters that are make believe or just not real. I have been playing this game since i was little, my grandmother introduced me to the game and I got pretty addicted. But, in my opinion that just goes to show this game is for ALL ages and everyone can enjoy it. So again please don‚Äôt blame the game for those that have worked hard to permanently earn a spot in gold/diamond. If you made it to the end of my LONG review, thanks for reading my report.

The game is also very predictable. If you build properties the next roll the next player almost every time won't land on you. I like the game, however another issue is that it freezes up at crucial junctures of the game. Such as after a trade. You have no choice after several minutes to abandon the game. Very frustrating after vesting so much time into it. Also I just finished a game & I bankrupted every player then it announced the last bankrupted player as the ‚Äúwinner!‚Äù. Ticks you off especially after spending an hour with idiots that want to make the same trade every single turn!

As far as games go this is the most addicting mobile game I‚Äôve personally played. I‚Äôve enjoyed it  since this game came to iOS and have even purchased some in-game cosmetic gear. I just wanna say I appreciate the devs don‚Äôt give any pay to win options in the game. Some of the tasks are annoying and the maps need balancing I think. Other than that I think the gameplay is the strongest aspect of this game as it preys on our natural suspicions of others and that‚Äôs an amazing concept for strangers and friends to play. The biggest problem I‚Äôve had though, and the reason for the 3 star rating is due to the fact that I can hardly even get matches when I want to. I get error messages often saying I was dropped from the server or that the matchmaker is full. As someone who has put money into this game I find this unacceptable. I understand the rare server issue here and there but when it takes over 20 minutes to search for game I feel like I‚Äôm literally wasting time. This game was the number one ranked action game at one point and there are ads at the end of every match. Surely the devs need to work out a better deal with their current sponsors. I really hope they don‚Äôt just divert all their assets into the planned sequel because I don‚Äôt believe the sequel will be as much of a success as it could be if any players are left disappointed in this game.",I get error messages often saying I was dropped from the server or that the matchmaker is full.,3,True,general,negative,5

I might only use one more move to win and I just wasted 900 coins or it takes me 6 moves but to up the ante a second time costs another 1200 coins. How often do people use the 2100 coins for an extra 10 moves and if they do, did it take them another 5 moves to win or just 1? Let us dish out 100 coins at a time or buy more bombs or something.

There are a few problems though. To name a few, when you use an ad to revive, sometimes you will respawn you end up in an area where you are supposed to be on top of a train, so all 3 lanes have trains coming at you just to kill you again and the only way to survive is to waste a board so you can crash into a train. Also, parts of the game don‚Äôt make sense. For example, you‚Äôll jump over a barrier and then you‚Äôll see a train going down the same lane where the barrier is just to run over it. Trains will also appear out of nowhere. Keys are another huge problem. They are so rare to find and then if you don‚Äôt want to watch an ad to revive, you have to pay at least one key. As you keep dying, you need more and more keys to the point where the amount needed is insanely high.

Listening to these songs, all the memories flow in and rush back, and I think about my brother and cousin building a mansion, and me begging to play, or when my brother would still play with me. This game was my childhood. And while everyone else is crooning over Fortnite, Minecraft remains the best. The music is just magnificent. But, there are a few things that need fixing. Whenever I get on, it says there was an account error, and I don‚Äôt even have an account. Also, I made a few characters and they fail to load. Finally, I just wish on Pocket Edition you could go back to different updates so I could play like I used to; no bees, no dolphins, no crazy stuff - just how the game started out. For me, listening to the soundtrack and the scent of Winter Candy Apple by Bath and Body Works brings back all the memories. Minecraft will always be with us.

It is fun and easy to learn how to play, and it kills time while making us think. I believe the new tournaments are fun, but it needs more. The levels need to make it so more coins can be earned. If I earn the minimum coins per level (50) and play 10 levels, it still isn‚Äôt enough to get a retry on a particularly hard level. Now I do think the fact they are called ‚ÄúHard Levels‚Äù makes it better for us to prepare, and definitely the coin amount there is worth it. But in order to pass a level, I spend almost 6-8 hearts if it‚Äôs extremely time-consuming and hard. There is still the issue with more prizes. I like the daily bonus, but after the seventh day, it sent me right back to the first day without any prizes. I believe it should be after the 7th day, you get all the prizes from day 1-6 at the same time, and then day 8 and on should have more until you reach every seventh day again. It‚Äôs a good way to make people play the game. There also need to be more tournaments that don‚Äôt give prizes based off places. I never get first place in the plane tournament, but in the knitting ball one, I got a lot of prizes and it made me feel more encouraged to try.

I deleted it after reaching level 20. The reason I deleted it is because it‚Äôs too boring to me. It was interesting fixing up the house but having to use multiple stars for some aspects and even to move to the next day is greedy. The bank I despised. Good premise but it holds coins you earn hostage unless you pay to buy it once you accumulate 3000 or 5000 coins. There is no choice either, you watch your coins disappear. The small mini games shown in the ads are the best part but they are way too few and far between. The majority of this game is playing levels over and over trying to get the next star to fix the never ending repairs. I also found having to use stars to open packages annoying. If I‚Äôm getting a gift it should be just. There is some humor and the scenes are colorful which is why i gave it two stars. Had the earning of coins been much higher, the mini games much more prevalent, the bank either free to obtain or at least an option, the limiting of one star per repair and not having to use stars on anything other than repairs I could have seen playing this longer. I tried these match three types of games several times now and always delete them quickly once the repetition of levels hits.

When you join ‚ÄúOnline Multiplayer‚Äù, and you‚Äôre playing, you can leave the app and come back however long later, and the game would continue from where you left off. This is the first evidence of AI in an online supposed real person mode. The second bit of evidence is that the AI trades at very specific rates: when you‚Äôre paying cash for a property, they want double the property price. If you offer too much lower than double, they‚Äôll permanently reject the offer. Closer to double, and they‚Äôll counter for double. Third bit of evidence is when they offer you a trade, and you decline. If they offered money, they‚Äôll make another offer increasing their offer by 10$. Decline again, they‚Äôll increase by 10$ again. And so on. Another issue is that on Multiplayer with friends, if you accidentally leave the app, you‚Äôre instantly replaced with an AI and there‚Äôs no way for you to rejoin.

As many other people have said, it often feels like the game is working against you maliciously so you‚Äôll be forced to buy more coins or power ups.

I always had used MCPE skin creator/editor and it worked amazingly but sad to know I can only do it on mobile. But put that aside, and you have an overall 90/10 game right now for me it‚Äôs perfect as it is. Sadly the original creators of Minecraft are gone and now bough by another company, if your reading this you might say, the new company is bad. But what they did to the game is so amazing, doing more than the original game designers would to with it.

The game doesn't feel the same after the update, and to any new players, I would no longer recommend it. I've played this game for 7 years now, and I've never been this disappointed. A friend of mine can no longer even load the game to play our world together. It's upsetting. It's truly upsetting. The game lags and my world's so corrupted entire chunks glitch out. I don't like it anymore. And no company should ever send out an update that they know has problems they have to acknowledge in the update notice. That's just uncalled for. I'm really upset with the direction the game's going and a lot of people are claiming to be having these problems. I don't want my world to be messed up forever. I don't want to lose this game, but I can not only bear to stand to play it, I literally can't keep it open with this update. Get it together.

It is a great game to play with friends and just play in your free time. I love being the imposter and being a crewmate is just as fun. Though, so people have been hacking the game and choosing who the imposter is, walking outside the ship, and sabotaging when they are even not a crewmate. (By the way, crewmates cannot sabotage.) It makes the game a little less fun, but it is still great. Though, recently, they updated it so that in the chat, you cannot say things that you want to say and instead you can only say stuff like ‚ÄúBlah is the imposter!‚Äù or ‚ÄúBlah vented!‚Äù (The imposter can go though vents to travel faster.) It is WAY more confusing than the older version and it makes it a little less enjoyable. When I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to operate the chat to say something, people assumed I was the imposter and voted me out. (You can vote people out if people vote them out.) I know that they did this so that it can be safer so that people don‚Äôt say bad words, but it is difficult. Also, I know that the people who made among us cannot change this, but could you at least put ‚ÄúI am having trouble using the chat,‚Äù or something like that?

This is not something that is acceptable on a free game but should be corrected immediately on a paid app.  While I enjoy the game, the fact that some many minutes and hours are wasted because games cannot be completed is totally unacceptable.  PLEASE FIX. Really enjoy Monopoly and love the game.  However reading the reviews, I find two issues that have popped up numerous times on other reviews that I am also experiencing also.  Since the last update, I have had several games that just freeze and you are out of luck.  What a waste of one, two hours plus, very frustrating.  The other really big issue is if you purchase the color block of Virginia, St Charles and States,  the Houses and Hotels tab covers Virginia and States and there is no way to add Houses and Hotels.  These are the two main issues that I have run into that others have as well.

Multiple people play together and say who is the imposter and some hackers are being able to kill in the middle of meetings and do visuals as imposter. Another reason is that there are no new maps.

Everyone thought it would come out in January or February, but it‚Äôs March and it still hasn‚Äôt come out yet. Another reason is that the new chat update can‚Äôt let you talk freely.

Some times, I have to spend like 20 minutes trying to connect my game. People say it‚Äôs my bad wifi, but that‚Äôs not true because my wifi works perfectly fine.

It can be technically called a brain game because the idea of lying and deceiving your ‚Äúteam‚Äù is very cool way to stretch your detective skills. Personally, this game is really fun! I wouldn‚Äôt give this game anything below 5 stars! But, there are a lot of things that concern me a little to. First, the over usage of bad words and #. It‚Äôs pretty hard to find a game where no one is constantly cussing inappropriate things in the chat, which ruins the game for everyone! On the other hand, there are some ridiculous hashtags marked on a word that isn‚Äôt even bad! Some people also put very disgusting things as their names. Another thing I would like to suggest is adding friends! Me and my friend just started playing together yesterday but it was very hard to get her into the same game as I am. Sometimes it‚Äôs very boring if we start a new game as host and no one‚Äôs joining! I think it would be nice to friend request and then we can request our friends to be able to join the public server we are in! It would save a ton of time.

Austin would have repaired it anyway. I am also confused about when Austin got to the house and went into his room and instead of a bed, there was a couch. Where did he sleep?

For a relatively simple game, it creates surprising amounts of tension, and with the right group of players, the experience can be a total blast. So, why the mediocre rating? Innersloth recently released what I can only describe as a ruinous, game-breaking update. Firstly, disconnections are frequent; in a game whose structure relies upon every player living long enough to cast out the killer(s) before meeting either win/loss condition, losing those players to disconnection means one less pair of hands for tasks, one less vote per meeting, one less identity to hide among, or one less partner to kill crewmates. If it were just one, a person could grouse and learn to get over it. But it is many. The problem is large enough to merit redress. And there are game-ending graphical errors, too. From time to time, avatars glitch through/into walls, or walk into out-of-bounds areas. I even lost a game once where I thought I broke another player‚Äôs alibi because she claimed to be someplace, but she was plainly visible right next to me. Turns out she wasn‚Äôt a liar‚Äîmy game was just glitchy. Post-game glitches often mean rebooting and losing your lobby, which is the end of the world, but can be really demoralizing when you finally find a cool group to play with.

Speaking of Mimi, if I‚Äôm correct she does have a pet otter which is super cute. I don‚Äôt know if the otter runs with her when she is trying to evade the inspector, but if it does I think that the Subway Surfers team should have a pet isle where players can choose an animal to run with them like the inspector has a dog. I would absolutely DIE if that could happen. I also definitely think that younger players would enjoy this.

Coins are sold in the shop for .99 cents per 900 which is crazy expensive considering 900 coins will on get 5 additional moves or 3 destroy balls (not sure what they are actually called). If 5 mores moves is not enough to complete the level the next 5 cost 1200 coins. The puzzles are designed to require boosts or additional moves. Each puzzle won rewards a star. Stars are required to perform actions for upgrading the garden or home. Though it is satisfying to watch the transformations and improvements I get frustrated when required to spend a star to greet someone at the door to receive a package, then another star to open the package. All the extra actions not related to actual upgrades seems like a complete waste of stars considering the difficulty of obtaining them.

Only between your hotels. It‚Äôs laughable at how predictable it is. If a 6 will land you on their hotel, you will roll that 6. I had a property of every color in my last game to ensure no one can build, so what happens? Yup, I land on their railroads only. So what do I do? I buy one of their railroads for a ridiculous price. The next turn, the computer acquired a railroad from another computer to re up the price. I know what you are thinking, why wouldn‚Äôt they buy that railroad prior so that they had all 4? Nah, only when I take the railroad away are they ALL OF A SUDDEN interested. It‚Äôs insanity how much they fix the games in favor of the computer.

Minecraft is one of the best games out there at least for me it is. I basically grew up playing it on my xbox 360. Nothing wrong with the gameplay or anything. But I do have one complaint. Now i‚Äôm not entirely sure if this a bug or a glitch so it might be nothing but it bothers me. So basically I play on the server: MineVille City. And when i go into one the minigames, that minigame being High-School Roleplay there are problems with my custom skin. So idk if this has to do with the server but this has happened most of the time. I walk around and when i pull up the pause menu my custom skin is replaced with a random skin. And I sometimes see other players with my skin equipped. And idk if my skin is working or not. Even when i do the inventory menu my custom skin is still there. So Mojang, if you see this then please reach out to me. My Minecraft account is a Xbox live account named Endermen21YT. So please if you can, look into this. Now this could totally just be the server or something else so this might not even be happening. I‚Äôve even noticed that this has happened to other ppl before on those servers. And it only happens when I enter the minigame. In the main server my skin‚Äôs fine. So anyway yeah that‚Äôs all.

There needs to be some sort of timer for everything so that way the game can keep moving or if someone doesn‚Äôt make any moves for a long period of time or purposely leaves the game they should go bankrupt and their properties should either get auctioned off or return back to the board for the other people to buy in the future. It‚Äôs super annoying having to leave a game because nobody is moving or being sore losers. I don‚Äôt have any interest in playing this game anymore because of this.

I first saw it played on Twitch and said I have got to experience this. The graphics, animation and modeling are really fun. Based on old reviews, I think many issues from the past are solved. The network seems reliable and the rules and variations are pretty much on point. The AI players add a new dimension. They are annoying at worst and a wonderful addition for shrewd dealing humans, at best. The klunky repetitious and nonsensical ‚Äúoffers‚Äù they make are pretty bad. And the fact that they only assess deals based on value of the deeds and classifying them as ‚Äúeasy, medium, or hard‚Äù just improves their luck and reduces yours makes them pretty frustrating at times. But they‚Äôre fun to push around and like I said, they create a whole new dimension in game play. Imagine making a deal with a predictable robot to mess up your human opponent, etc. That said, the overall game feels cold and lonely. How do we know we are really playing against a human when we join Multiplayer online? What is our own record of wins and losses? What if we want to play against a particular player again?

When you join ‚ÄúOnline Multiplayer‚Äù, and you‚Äôre playing, you can leave the app and come back however long later, and the game would continue from where you left off. This is the first evidence of AI in an online supposed real person mode. The second bit of evidence is that the AI trades at very specific rates: when you‚Äôre paying cash for a property, they want double the property price. If you offer too much lower than double, they‚Äôll permanently reject the offer. Closer to double, and they‚Äôll counter for double. Third bit of evidence is when they offer you a trade, and you decline. If they offered money, they‚Äôll make another offer increasing their offer by 10$. Decline again, they‚Äôll increase by 10$ again. And so on. Another issue is that on Multiplayer with friends, if you accidentally leave the app, you‚Äôre instantly replaced with an AI and there‚Äôs no way for you to rejoin. This makes your phone unusable other than to play the game if you don‚Äôt want to erase all the progress you‚Äôve just made on a match with a friend. Please look into this.

To break it down for you: I‚Äôm at level 122 (which is impossible to beat without a booster because of how it is set up), which is about midway through the 5th decoration level in the game (haven‚Äôt even broached the upstairs level yet).

It always makes road trips boring for me if I want to play minecraft with a friend. Also, if you guys could make it where people can share a wolf. My first wolf from the beginning passed away tonight due to a skeleton attack. Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone‚Äôs been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful. Also if you could make it where villagers, foxes, and mobs can be leashed. That‚Äôs all my requests for now.

It‚Äôs a really fun game that you should share with your friends and challenge each other. Sometimes you can even get a new high score.

It is very entertaining and sometimes I spend hours in a day playing it. The levels seem to get really difficult after you start renovating the third room. I really find it so frustrating that we have to wait 30 minutes for each life to come back. Also, the amount of moves given in each level is ridiculous. Sometimes, you need just 2 more moves to pass the level and you can‚Äôt because you‚Äôre out of moves. Then, if you want more, you have to pay 900 coins for only five more moves. And if you don‚Äôt have the money, you have to forfeit and loose the game. Other times, you can join competitions and get really cool power ups. If I get stuck on one of the levels in the challenges, I loose all my prizes and earned money. The point of the game is to be fun and decorate a house, which honestly is my favorite part of the game. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the matching part of the game is so fun too, I just hate the fact that you have to wait so long to get lives and some of the tasks they ask you to do are just ridiculous. As an example, if I got a cat in the game, it says I need to give a star just to name it. I mean that‚Äôs ridiculous.

However, I would really like to see some better incentives to keep players in the game. For some of the side challenges (e.g. knitting), the rewards, such as unlimited lives for a certain period of time, are given immediately. If I had the option to save that reward for a rainy day, perhaps when I‚Äôm tackling a particularly difficult level, I‚Äôd be more inclined to play for longer periods of time. When this happens, however, it‚Äôs almost always the case that I don‚Äôt have the time to actually use said reward and it ends up being useless. I‚Äôd also like to see the coin rewards have a better balance. 50-70 coins as a reward for each level won? Come on! What about an additional ten or so coins for each remaining turn? Say if I‚Äôve beaten a level and I have five turns left. I should win the base coins of fifty and then an additional fifty for each turn I didn‚Äôt use. For harder levels, base coins of 100 and then an additional fifty coins for each additional remaining turn. Now THAT‚ÄôS an incentive! That would be rad.

I thoroughly enjoy the puzzle aspect itself, more so than competing puzzle games. The animations are smoother, the power ups are well thought out and exciting to use, and the puzzles are fun. I'm docking points though, because the storylines are infuriating to deal with. What roped me in to downloading this game was the home decor aspect. As a huge fan of interior design, this seemed like the perfect game for me. I got to play fun levels, but also simultaneously get to decorate a home. However, after spending months on this game, and completing 240 levels, I've only just now unlocked the 3rd room. If you can even call it that. It goes living room, kitchen, and then garden? Why!? There are TONS of rooms in this house, and after TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTY levels, I'm decorating a garden while so much of the house is untouched. Don't even get me started on the baking storyline. 6 stars just to bake the cake base. Another 3 to bake the house cake. Another 3 to frost it. Another 3 to put it together. Then 2 to drive it to the studio. Then 2 to celebrate the win. Then another 2 to open a present for winning... it doesn't stop! I didn't download the game to bake a cake. I downloaded it to furnish a house! Stop with that nonsense. It took WEEKS to get through that ridiculous storyline.

I Also think this game should have a save game feature because if you are in a game and you have a HUGE score, and your device shuts down by accident, or even just turns off you lose all your progress!! To add on to that point, they should have some sort of button to press when you have to go and you are in the middle of a run, so when you have to go, you press the button and it saves the run so you can go back into the game another time.

I also have a problem with some of the people in the game treat it as if it‚Äôs tinder and flirt with people in the game. I know there‚Äôs probably no fixing that but it kinda gets annoying being for them to be like that. Also, I think you should make like a friend thing where like you can befriend people in the game and they can send you ( or you send them) friend request and when either of you accept then you can chat with them and join the same game as them so you don‚Äôt have to go through like hundreds of other servers to see them again.

The game used to be so enjoyable, and now I probably won‚Äôt be playing it again. There are many other ways to fix this problem, but restricting what people can type so that they can‚Äôt get their point across is not the way to do it.

To be honest you ruined your own game. The bulk of people that play are teens and now we have no freedom. We get all of these restrictions everywhere and you had to add among to that list. I‚Äôm very disappointed. If you could lower the age for safe chat from 18 to 13 that would be great. 18 is very unrealistic compared to 13 which is much more reasonable. Also look at all of the reviews your getting. People aren‚Äôt happy and your star level is dropping. I‚Äôll let that speak for itself. Just change the game back or tweak the update please.

But ever since Character Creator has been added to the game, my custom skins have been looking off. I use slim-armed skins because I prefer them over classic skins but the glitch only occurs on slim-armed skins. Let‚Äôs say you have a slim-armed skin, and you wanted a unique design on each leg. Like different-lengthened socks, or a flower on one and a star on the other. Then when you upload the skin on the game, whatever way you designed the right leg (it looks like the left leg if you look straight at the skin) gets copy and pasted automatically onto the left leg (right leg if you look at the skin straight at the face). It looks distorted, as I don‚Äôt know if other players can or cannot see the error besides yourself, but it‚Äôs basically both legs are symmetrical while a lot of skin designers like not making symmetrical, and the second layer on the leg that gets changed to looking like the other stays. So basically the glitched leg looks exactly like the other leg that looks perfectly fine, but has second layer on it. Like then both legs would have like a flower on it but the star‚Äôs second layer is stuck on top of the copy and pasted flower. Pretty odd right?

When you only win between 50 and 100 coins ( on a really good round) it takes a really long time to recoup. They are very stingy with giving you boosters and chances to get more coins.

Ever since the update was released, there is always little no none chatting when discussing who the imposter might be. Also, a way to make this less of a problem is to give people the option to not use the new chat so they could type what they want.

Also, the restrictions on what you can type in the chat like ‚ÄúAdmin‚Äù can lead to others thinking you were in Admin but that was where the murder was, not where you were.

The concept and game idea itself is why people enjoy playing so much. The game allows you to work to deceive and lie to people in a way that is totally expectable socially because it‚Äôs all for sun and games. It‚Äôs the same game over and over and over again yet you still have people returning to play more which really says something about how great it is. I could play like 20 games in a row and never get bored. A lot of people feel this same way which is probably why the game is so successful and although that‚Äôs good, it comes with a price. That price is more content. People need more and more content and if the demand isn‚Äôt met with even small additions like new tasks or new colors for characters then the game will slowly start to die out. A big thing people want is the ability to have friends. You can play like 40 games with the same person and really bond with them and get to know them, only for both of you to be kicked out of the game for an update or hacking or something and you‚Äôd never be able to see them again.

This is not something that is acceptable on a free game but should be corrected immediately on a paid app.  While I enjoy the game, the fact that some many minutes and hours are wasted because games cannot be completed is totally unacceptable.  PLEASE FIX. Really enjoy Monopoly and love the game.  However reading the reviews, I find two issues that have popped up numerous times on other reviews that I am also experiencing also.  Since the last update, I have had several games that just freeze and you are out of luck.  What a waste of one, two hours plus, very frustrating.  The other really big issue is if you purchase the color block of Virginia, St Charles and States,  the Houses and Hotels tab covers Virginia and States and there is no way to add Houses and Hotels.

That‚Äôs fine, but the problem is you have to scroll through dozens and dozens of blank decks to get to the decks you‚Äôve paid for. There is no way to rearrange, prioritize, or delete decks. There is also no way to contact support to tell them of these issues or ask for a refund, since the game doesn‚Äôt work.","That‚Äôs fine, but the problem is you have to scroll through dozens and dozens of blank decks to get to the decks you‚Äôve paid for.",3,True,enjoyability,negative,4

I love this game, I‚Äôm obsessed, I play all the time and I love it!The concept is great! Ten or so people, most are crewmates, who are supposed to fix the ship and keep an eye on things. A couple, however, are imposters and they are supposed to kill all the crewmates while pretending to be one of them. Its a great game. The concept works great! There are so many strategies to use and its so open ended even with rules in place.But however, the new update may have just ruined things for me. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the quick chat was a good idea, but it doesn‚Äôt work as well as you would think. First off, its missing some crucial phrases and questions. Its like impossible to now ask for proof or evidence. If someone doesn‚Äôt give it, you can‚Äôt get it cause you can‚Äôt ask ‚ÄúProof?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù. You also can‚Äôt really question people as easily. This makes it very limiting. That wouldn‚Äôt be as much of a problem if you could use the free chat too, but now you can‚Äôt. As of the update, you cannot use the free chat if you are under 18. This basically ruins the game for all kids. The free chat is good, but not by itself. It extremely limits what you can say and how you get info. It just does not work. Please fix this InnerSloth. Other than that, its a great game!",You also can‚Äôt really question people as easily.,3,True,general,positive,5

But, I would like to request a feature. Could there be an option to have more intelligent crew mates/impostors in free play? For example: I start up free play and see an option saying ‚Äúwould you like to turn on intelligent mode?‚Äù I turn it on and free play starts. It has usual free play features like picking tasks and being the impostor. But with one major difference: the AI is more intelligent. I‚Äôll give you a look at both sides of this mode. CREWMATE VIEW:You run around doing tasks with the other AI crew mates. And one of the crew mates is the impostor. The impostor‚Äôs AI does intelligent stuff like: trapping you in rooms, sabotaging electricity and such, and so much more! IMPOSTOR VIEW:The crew mates are doing tasks. While your the impostor. You take down the AI crew mates and such. But the AI crew mates does intelligent things like the AI impostor. Like:Reporting dead bodies, calling emergency meetings, and so much more! I would love to see all of this added into free play mode. I will be awaiting your response.EDIT:Ok, I think a great feature to have would be when the impostor kills you and your pet cries, you can comfort it. Like pet it and tell it everything is gonna be okay. Then it‚Äôs happy and it starts following your ghost. I would love this feature. Once again, I will be awaiting your response.‚ÄîYour biggest fan",Then it‚Äôs happy and it starts following your ghost.,5,True,general,positive,5

I think not!!!,"Almost all the reviews boil down to the same basic complements and complaints.  So why is nothing done to change things (example; coin and star ratios for each level)  I would pay for the game if it meant a more level playing field.  News flash folks... like everything else on the internet the developers are out to fill their coffers and nothing more.  That‚Äôs why this and every other game like it has such a low win ratio (stars & coins).  They are out for your real life dollars, and don‚Äôt give a rats tail about what you think or comments you make.  That‚Äôs how our society and economy work.  You want to progress quicker... pay up.  The only way you can change it is to not spend the money.  Money or lack there of is what gets their attention nothing else.  They will never read this or any other comment.  Or if hell freezes over and they do, they sure don‚Äôt care about what we think of their business practices and never will as long as someone out there is spending real money to advance in the game.  Bottom line... play but don‚Äôt pay otherwise no changes will ever occur.",Almost all the reviews boil down to the same basic complements and complaints.,5,True,learnability,negative,6

Stop saying we‚Äôre sorry to hear that you feel that way!,"Developers stop saying that we are sorry to hear that you feel that way! And that the monopoly chance mechanics are statistically random!  If that were the case, you wouldn‚Äôt have a bunch of people complaining about the way the game plays and cheats!Just fix the dang game! This is why you have a bunch of what you so call, rage quitters! Because they realize sometime in the beginning of the game, and sometime in the middle of the game,  that this program has already pre-determined who the winner is! And I believe the predetermined winner is at the beginning of the game! It is so obvious the way the dice rolls, you can pretty much guess the outcome!  No one is stupid,  unless you‚Äôre five years old! We all know what‚Äôs going on, and please don‚Äôt play on it like we don‚Äôt! So once again, fix the game, or rather unfix the game!

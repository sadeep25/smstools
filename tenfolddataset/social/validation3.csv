We are not China or Cuba or Venezuela to do that to it’s people!!!   The censoring and control to do this to their people on Facebook is a disgrace.

They should get on this immediately and at least email me back to let me know something.

I looked online and apparently sometimes Discord can be “down” (Which is bizarre. I’ve had it with Snapchat too.) which is very disappointing to me. In my opinion these apps should never go “down”. iMessage is never down, so why are these? It boggles my mind sometimes how poorly made this app is. And no I won’t delete it because I use it often.

It does an amazing job at keeping notifications hidden when you want them to be.But I cannot say the same for calls. Recently, Discord started integrating their calls with actual phone calls. This means that every time I get called on Discord, it goes through to my ringtone. The whole reason I use Discord is to keep my online life separate from my personal life. Although there is a setting that allows you to disable this feature, I still get the ringtone. Whenever I get called on Discord, even though the app is closed, I still get a ringtone. I even have all notifications turned off in my settings. The ringtone only lasts about 2 seconds before it realizes that it should not be there, but it gets pretty annoying, since it forces me to stop whatever i’m doing on my phone.What annoys me the most is that this issue has been fixed before. The previous update had the setting that disabled the integrated phone calls, but it actually did its job, unlike this recent update. I had no calls going through no matter how much I was getting spammed with calls. I thought this problem would be gone forever, but it still managed to find its way back.

(There is also a ""when read"" timestamp, but that has no bearing here.) Over the course of the past weeks and months, the timestamps show frequent delivery delays of 20 minutes, 30 minutes, and sometimes even hours. Some messages are never delivered. These frequent long delays defeat the central requirement of a working text message system -- conversations that happen in near real time. It's like having a car with revolutionary safety features that only starts half the time, or stalls for 30 minutes every few trips. It is unacceptable.

The audio quality is much better than normal phone calls and it’s a great way to text my friends aside from Snapchat and iMessage. But a lot of the time it either doesn’t work and I can’t hear who I’m on the phone with, or today for example it won’t connect at all. It’s actually making me very anxious because there may be something important on Discord. In my opinion this is a very poorly made app, I think that if you’re going to take the time and pay the money to create an app as popular as Discord then you should at least make it effective. I looked online and apparently sometimes Discord can be “down” (Which is bizarre. I’ve had it with Snapchat too.) which is very disappointing to me. In my opinion these apps should never go “down”. iMessage is never down, so why are these? It boggles my mind sometimes how poorly made this app is. And no I won’t delete it because I use it often. But I am very strongly requesting a major improvement, because this isn’t working. This is bad. Somebody really needs to get to fixing it.

I’ve noticed that I have the same account in TextMe and FreeTone, one app being on iPad and the other on iPhone (both apps work on iPhone and iPad). The same chosen virtual numbers, call history and messages, number of credits purchased, and the same userID, which the derive from the parting of the email address before @. So, to avoid confusion, I logged out from TextMe and meant to delete it. !!! I was shocked to find out that I was also logged out on FreeTone and when I tried to relogin on FreeTone, it told me that my account doesn’t exit. Same when I tried to relogin in TextMe.The axed my account with something like $50 worth of calling credits I paid for with money via iTunes. (It’s independently documented.)There is no ability to contact support through the app, at least without account.

And for all users, better stay away from these schemers. There is number of the same apps which work more reliably and are honest, while this one would end up steeling your money. I have used for years and highly recommend the following alternatives:1. Sideline (can work via Wi-Fi and via cellular network, i.e. in a “calling card” mode, but you receive calls too. Extremely useful is you happen to be away from Wi-Fi)    It pays for U.S. calls with ads, but you can block all adds on iPhone/iPad (not just in Safari) with AdGuard, Adblocker Mobile and number of others2. Dingtone and and TalkU (also from the same developer, but features are different and they work independently).3. TextFree voiceNot to mention Skype, which supports many virtual call out numbers, and you get 60 international minutes free every month, if you pay for $98 for MS Office, plus 1T on OneDriveOr Google HangOuts, just first set up Google Voice and get a virtual number. They charge $20 (I think) for changing the number, so it’s not a “burner number” app, neither are those I have mentioned here. Even burner apps charge for a new number.FreeTone and TextMe, though, are malware with two heads, to steel your credits purchased for money.

One of the most annoying parts of this is because I initially started to use discord to escape the mobile callkit in other apps. I understand the features of this some may find appealing.

I re-downloaded the app recently because I was joining a clan and they required discord. I got the app and I was still logged into my old account, which was glitched, so I created a new one. I actually had to create that account on my browser because the app didn’t even let me do that. I created my account and tried to login on the app, no success. I’ve re-downloaded the app numerous times since then and still, no success logging in. Luckily, my browser still works and I use that to chat with my clan. Unfortunately, even when I turn my phone sideways, I can’t see all of the writing because it shows all the members of the group on the right hand side and it takes up half of the screen.

I think I've been a member of Facebook since 2011. Didn't want to do social media but my mom made me an account anyway. Facebook is my first social media account and will probably be my last.I would first like to say is that I love reading comments. It annoys me is when the comments are blank and don't load. I don't know what it is but what is the point of constant updates when clearly it doesn't fix much?A couple years ago there was a list of all these pages for me to like and follow such as movies, tv shows, artists, etc. because Facebook wanted to see what kind of things I like. Like ads, it bombards my page but even more than the ads itself. I click on the page to either ""unlike"" or ""see less of this"" but it puts another page in its place to bombard me all over again. They need to add a setting where it allows users to show less of every page they liked or followed, not just 1.Lastly, I am sick and tired of getting requests sent to me of games I've never heard of by friends and family. Why do I have to constantly go into settings to turn off notifications of a game? The problem is that I can only block the game notifications   AFTER I get them.

It is a normal process for this to happen four-five times before I can even access the app, and then the real fun begins. 5 minutes later after waiting for crash after crash, I get a bug that won't let me open a text conversation. I have to force quit the app and restart, at which point it crashes again. It splits my texts between two separate conversations for some reason. It used to show an ad after the odd text, but after a recent update I realized there were no performance or stability improvements, it did nothing but triple the amount of ads, sometimes playing data-eating HD video ads with loud and obnoxious audio that CONTINUED TO PLAY EVEN WHEN I LOCKED MY DEVICE. After all that, the app didn't even do what it was designed to. I showed up to a film set where the manager showed me a text  that I never got. She was trying to hire me for the shoot, and I didn't get the job because the text didn't reach me, though I checked the number. On at least 6 other occasions, I was shown texts that didn't reach me.

Night Mode - a setting with black chat bubbles and white font, black background, and dulled colors for use at night. This is so essential.2. Editing - allow users to edit messages. This is a very desired feature for writers and professional chats. Messages can show they were “edited” or even show edit history if it’s a concern. But having the option to fix typos and misspellings is so key.3. Chat color choices - offer more than just light green bubble choices. Offer a wide range of colors (including gradients) as a fun feature that allows for customization. 4. Reactions - allow a set of reactions to messages including heart, thumbs up and down, and possibly some basic emojis. This makes communication much more efficient.I hope the developers will seriously consider adding all of these features!

When using broadcast lists, the recipients can't tell that the message was sent to a broadcast. I really like the broadcast list rather than creating a group because on a group everybody gets every reply, which is usually unnecessary. But when I use a broadcast list I get a lot of messages asking if I meant to send to a group. It's not a big deal at all so I still give the app five stars.

So if I have to refer back to it for any reason, I have to somehow find the page of the original poster and then hunt for the post.

Yes I have access to  their page, I haven’t been blocked and they call me to say “did you see my last post” and all I see is nothing. 3) Auto refresh is annoying.

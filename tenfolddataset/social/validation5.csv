And when the mods are ineffective at creating a safe environment, that‚Äôs when toxic behavior thrives. Discord does have some policies, on its ToS but these are generally very simple rules, and are few and far between. I‚Äôve had many terrible experiences on servers where toxic behavior is present and the mods either do nothing about it or they take the wrong course of action.

But the mobile version is missing quite a few important features. For example, Discord on mobile (possibly IOS only) doesn't have Audit Logs for server moderation. Audit Logs are very important for server moderation, so that is one flaw with the mobile app. Also, only a minor setback this is, is the fact that there is no emote button on the mobile app. Yes, you can easily tap the emoji button on your keyboard, but if you are in a server with global emotes, you have to type out the names of the emote. But, there is emote prediction, making this a minor set back. Finally, I want to mention this weird bug that happens sometimes; It is a bug when you can't join Voice Channels or Voice Calls; it just disconnects you automatically, and it does this for a loop. When you close the app and retry, the same results will happen. You usually have to wait hours before you can join a Voice Channel or Voice Call again. Thank you for making such a wonderful app!

However, despite the amazing things the team has done, the mobile is still equivalent to urinating into an anthill. It‚Äôs difficult to get started, and when you‚Äôre using it there are always issues while doing it. When in a discord call in a Server, it works fine for a portion of the time in it. However at some point, the app stops allowing voice chat the moment I leave and look at memes or other things. And it only begins again when I go back in,Ultimately resulting in me having to restart the app. Second, when using discord, while in a call, the screen will suddenly shut off, but the phone will not and not turn the screen on unless hitting the power button or waiting for brief flashes of the screen. This is increasingly angering as I talk to my friends, trying to share memes, or other things and my screen is refusing to work. Please pay more attention to the mobile version, to make it equal to the laptop version, as it is difficult and a struggle to use.

Also, this is the most invasive app in the App Store. Facebook mines your personal information 24/7.

It‚Äôs an easy to understand usage, for me, and simple to join servers. And the ability to create various rooms for various things also is good and creative as it allows for different topics to be shared. However, despite the amazing things the team has done, the mobile is still equivalent to urinating into an anthill. It‚Äôs difficult to get started, and when you‚Äôre using it there are always issues while doing it. When in a discord call in a Server, it works fine for a portion of the time in it. However at some point, the app stops allowing voice chat the moment I leave and look at memes or other things. And it only begins again when I go back in,Ultimately resulting in me having to restart the app. Second, when using discord, while in a call, the screen will suddenly shut off, but the phone will not and not turn the screen on unless hitting the power button or waiting for brief flashes of the screen. This is increasingly angering as I talk to my friends, trying to share memes, or other things and my screen is refusing to work.

I can‚Äôt respond to new customers my business has been at a halt literally a day after launch. If someone would actually open my account or take the time to respond I would gladly rate higher. But for a Major app to have no phone support and no email support or a live chat is sad. They don‚Äôt care enough to help or respond in any way. Just want back into my account.

I think I've been a member of Facebook since 2011. Didn't want to do social media but my mom made me an account anyway. Facebook is my first social media account and will probably be my last.I would first like to say is that I love reading comments. It annoys me is when the comments are blank and don't load. I don't know what it is but what is the point of constant updates when clearly it doesn't fix much?A couple years ago there was a list of all these pages for me to like and follow such as movies, tv shows, artists, etc. because Facebook wanted to see what kind of things I like. Like ads, it bombards my page but even more than the ads itself. I click on the page to either ""unlike"" or ""see less of this"" but it puts another page in its place to bombard me all over again. They need to add a setting where it allows users to show less of every page they liked or followed, not just 1.Lastly, I am sick and tired of getting requests sent to me of games I've never heard of by friends and family. Why do I have to constantly go into settings to turn off notifications of a game? The problem is that I can only block the game notifications   AFTER I get them. Seriously, they need to add a setting where it blocks every game notification request PERIOD. There should be no need to go back in settings when Facebook should be capable of blocking all future game notifications.It's almost 2018.

And it‚Äôs not because the employees and staff working at discord are mean, or anything, it‚Äôs because of the nature of the setup discord chooses to use. Essentially when you join a server, the guidelines you have are the ones the owner sets for you. Larger servers are often governed by mods. But the problem is that these mods generally don‚Äôt have too many qualifications to be a moderator. And when the mods are ineffective at creating a safe environment, that‚Äôs when toxic behavior thrives. Discord does have some policies, on its ToS but these are generally very simple rules, and are few and far between. I‚Äôve had many terrible experiences on servers where toxic behavior is present and the mods either do nothing about it or they take the wrong course of action. Now this isn‚Äôt something discord has much control over, but rather design of the website in it‚Äôs entirety is flawed. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this app to people who who are not in a healthy state of mind, or to anyone in general. However I guess discord works for some people and if you find that this style of social media works for you then by all means download it. But do be prepared for possible toxic behavior thrown your way.","Essentially when you join a server, the guidelines you have are the ones the owner sets for you.",2,True,effectiveness,server,29.0,35.0,negative,1

Secondly, if you turn notifications off, discord calls should go away anyway.- Not user friendly. Discord is not very user friendly and you have to get used to it.

I'm not sure if it's a bug, but now, just to change my profile picture, I have to send the picture to my computer, download it from my email, and then set it as my picture, it's pretty annoying, especially since my computer isn't the best and takes a little while just to start up, and then I have to get to my email, which also takes a while to load.I hope this doesn't seem entitled, but it would be very nice if this could be fixed or changed so that it would be easier to change a profile picture.

Like ads, it bombards my page but even more than the ads itself. I click on the page to either ""unlike"" or ""see less of this"" but it puts another page in its place to bombard me all over again. They need to add a setting where it allows users to show less of every page they liked or followed, not just 1.Lastly, I am sick and tired of getting requests sent to me of games I've never heard of by friends and family.

The bots in discord are good as well, because you can use them to play music, look things up, and more. Also, discord is a good way to chat with strangers and meet new people, without giving out your phone number. And as a final touch, discord’s sense of humor is great. It feels like there are no Easter eggs or humor in any software/apps these days, but discord is different: it has a friendly interface, with many features implemented that are funny.

Over the course of the past weeks and months, the timestamps show frequent delivery delays of 20 minutes, 30 minutes, and sometimes even hours. Some messages are never delivered. These frequent long delays defeat the central requirement of a working text message system -- conversations that happen in near real time.

Even when I requested a review, they said I posted something that violated community standards, (which, by the way, are a complete joke). They’ll allow terrorist support groups, and groups that encourage violence against others that oppose a certain political spectrum, yet label people and ban them. It’s absolutely ludicrous.

Instagram and Twitter are dizzying apps with way too many features, and engagement/content is prioritized over conversation- that approach is far from what Discord's approach is, so it makes sense to me that y'all would avoid that visual language. pleeeease restore the prior, rectangular, text box interface.

Not sure if it’s a bug that would be fixed or deliberately done.Few things I noticed are;1) The inability to fast forward or rewind voice messages.This is very handy function as sometimes we just need to quickly get a point from a voice message we have previously listens to and so on. 2) When viewing status that has audio we have the ability to increase the audio by using our phone volume keys and able to set it to the desire volume. But now it’s volume is static once you push the button at the start of the status it added audio that can neither been increased nor decreased. Please try to look into this as it’s embarrassing having your phone on highest volume in public places and be unable to adjust it.

I have to restart the app every time I change my pfp.The stream audio quality on mobile periodically worsens until words are unintelligible before fixing itself. Exiting and rejoining both the stream and call don’t fix this chronic issue.I also have issues during calls where I can’t hear the person I’m calling and vice versa. Discord has also kicked both of us from the call before but still shown each other as in the call. (aka each person sees themselves and the other in the call, when in reality both have been kicked and do not know it)The biggest pain is that the app overall is has become laggier. The lag has worsened since the UI change adding the gift button and send button animation from a while ago. Simple tasks like sending messages, getting the interface to show so I can unmute while watching someone’s stream, are a chore since I have to wait so long for Discord to do it’s thing. (5+ seconds. This may not sound like much but time it using a timer and imagine waiting that long for every process to load while you’re in a call)Lastly, Discord also seems to be battery hungry. When I join calls my phone becomes burning hot and the battery percentage drops very quickly. I don’t seem to have this issue with zoom.Thanks for reading.

After awhile I found it to be a bit too invasive and left. Years later I rejoined again for family reasons. I began to use it for national and international news and political interest as well. Over the years, and especially during this election year, Facebook became increasingly biased against conservative views. The “fact checkers,” engineers and executives seem to work overtime to censor important conservative news and information, to stifle free speech and exchange of information and discourse, and to often shut down members who do not tow some of the leftist political lines, talking points and agendas. I now feel like it is becoming a literal arm of the globalist/socialist/leftist juggernaut which is intent on introducing a controlling groupthink mentality on the world. What was once an entertaining and educational forum has become very partisan, very controlling and even divisive.

Another thing is when I see some people’s status when it says something like “Playing Sleeping”, “Playing And 3...2...1..”, etc, I want that option to be available to mobile devices, or if that is already available, please respond to me with how I would do that.  One last thing is when I try to save a picture with a transparent background, when I go look at it in my photos, it doesn’t go from a white background to taping to a black background.

When you want to leave a server you’ve created, you have the option to pass ownership to someone you trust or someone that’s qualified. It isn’t the same for group chats, though. If I had created a group chat, and had to leave, I would also want to pass the ability of owner to someone trusted, but it randomly picks a member to make the new owner. As the owner, I think I should be the one making that choice. Because even though I absolutely love my discord friends, some of them tend to abuse the power of owner chaotically, and I don’t want to be added back into that kind of environment.

I only have one request, please let us be able to disable the camera sound from settings. Just like you can disable the sound it makes when it takes a picture in apps like Snapchat. The only way of getting rid of the noice made by the camera is by turning your ringer off. I use the camera a lot so after a while the sound becomes annoying, leaving me no other choice but to turn my ringer off. Problem is I need the ringer on and it has already happened to me that I miss several important calls or can’t locate my phone when calling because I forget to turn it back on.It would be lifesaving if you could do that please, I don’t think it’s something complicated.

I love being able to chat with my friends regardless of their “status” IE: online, invis, etc. I also love the ability of being able to “condense” servers into folders for easier access, or to simply put them on the back shelf. I like how easy it is to create a server and that’s it’s free. It doesn’t cost me anything extra to join a server, or make one. I also immensely enjoy the customization of discord. I like being able to customize channels and permissions and such for servers that I own. One thing I find annoying, is that everytime discord updates, I lose my “most used” emoji list, though in all fairness, this is a very minor nuisance. Discord has fixed so many bugs in the past and I’m glad the Dev’s are active and actually do their best to fix issues. I remember a time when if a message was copied from discord to word, then it’d have a black background and it’d be annoying to remove on word. But now that’s no longer an issue. Another past and resolved issue was ghost messages. Someone sends a message but if the app was closed or crashed, then a copy of said sent message, was waiting in the text box.Overall, I love using discord and I will continue to do so.","Someone sends a message but if the app was closed or crashed, then a copy of said sent message, was waiting in the text box.",5,True,usability,text box,116.0,124.0,negative,8

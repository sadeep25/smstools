(But there is also a verbal chat option if you prefer talking) If spending time with people in person wears you out or is stressful to you, discord is a great way to make friends at your own pace.Edit: Since the new update, there have been in app notifications that block other things and can’t be turned off. In order to stop them, you have to mute everything which would also get rid of notifications out of the app which I do not want to turn off. These really takes away from the experience. I’ve seen developer responses on other reviews saying they are working on a way to disable the in app notifications and this will be in the next update. I really hope that update comes soon. Until then, I’m lowering my rating of a 5 out of 5 stars to a 4 out of 5 stars.Edit: They have since fixed the problem.","Edit: Since the new update, there have been in app notifications that block other things and can’t be turned off.",5,True,usability,notification,52.0,64.0,negative,8

I re-downloaded the app recently because I was joining a clan and they required discord. I got the app and I was still logged into my old account, which was glitched, so I created a new one. I actually had to create that account on my browser because the app didn’t even let me do that. I created my account and tried to login on the app, no success. I’ve re-downloaded the app numerous times since then and still, no success logging in. Luckily, my browser still works and I use that to chat with my clan. Unfortunately, even when I turn my phone sideways, I can’t see all of the writing because it shows all the members of the group on the right hand side and it takes up half of the screen. Then, I have to read downwards one letter at a time and I don’t have the patience for that, especially with all of the scrolling it requires. If I could get on the app and not have to worry about that, I would have no complaints, but this simple fix is ruining the entire app for me.

If you’re typing and then click on the completed word and hit space afterward, it actually backspaces and erases the last letter of the word that was just put there. If you don’t catch it and retype the last letter and hit space and start typing the next word, you end up with one long word instead of two.

For one discord occasionally glitches out making me unable to hear my friends which requires me to completely restart the app.  Which is fine normally but when I’m playing games it’s not always easy to restart discord. Sometimes it leaves and joins the call for no reason, just disconnects and reconnects Atleast 4 times. And occasionally it turns of speaker mode at random.

The push-to-talk key, I find, is not sensitive enough. I think that the app is not very user friendly, making you open up a full screen window to just poke someone. Things should be a bit easier. I know the app can be better; the computer version is awesome and I hope this app gets there. It is such a good tool for talking to my friends but this version needs improvement.

You can do that. Change your display name for only one, specific server? You can do that too. But for me the most valuable thing about Discord is the sense of community that you feel almost immediately after logging on. Depending on your server choices you’ll almost always have an unread message, meaning there’s almost always something or someone for you to come back to. And if you don’t want to be bothered? Turn off notifications for servers and channels you don’t want to hear from. Not once have I had a security issue or even fear that I would lose personal information.

The nitro is 𝙡𝙊𝙊$! That’s a lot for such little things. And a lot of people can’t afford that, so I would lower the price to maybe 50$ or around that area. Also I know there is some way to change it but I have no idea how so this isn’t much of a complaint but I just hate it when I put :) and it goes to 🙂 or :( to 😦just..no sorry-. And my last complaint is videos and pictures.. I can only send 1 second Vids bc it has to be under 8 something I don’t remember but it’s like a limit.

You must individually look up and share each group, which is cumbersome and takes far more steps/time. My child is a brand Rep, and it used to be so convenient to make our promotion post and share in 5-10 groups with a few quick taps. Now, I have to individually share the post to each individual group. I understand it is probably some kind of safety feature to prevent hackers and bots and bugs, but it has really made it more difficult for us. Also, the new layout on the computer (not the app, but the physical website) has me all sorts of lost and confused.

One of the more recent updates, however, made it so when someone called you through the app, it would act as a phone call on your phone. This is an issue with maybe privacy, but also while you’re using the app. Since calls are so spammable in DMs or Group DMs, the call screen will appear on your phone and disappear rapidly. While on the calling screen, you cannot do anything other than accept or decline the call. This is an issue because that basically makes it so if someone spam calls you, you can’t do anything until they stop. If you go to block them, it will take much too long. Other than this issue, the developers are pretty good about fixing bugs within the app. Also, if I’m listening to music when I join a call and then leave, my music will have messed up audio after.","One of the more recent updates, however, made it so when someone called you through the app, it would act as a phone call on your phone.",4,True,general,phone call,112.0,122.0,positive,4

I have to restart the app every time I change my pfp.The stream audio quality on mobile periodically worsens until words are unintelligible before fixing itself. Exiting and rejoining both the stream and call don’t fix this chronic issue.I also have issues during calls where I can’t hear the person I’m calling and vice versa. Discord has also kicked both of us from the call before but still shown each other as in the call. (aka each person sees themselves and the other in the call, when in reality both have been kicked and do not know it)The biggest pain is that the app overall is has become laggier. The lag has worsened since the UI change adding the gift button and send button animation from a while ago. Simple tasks like sending messages, getting the interface to show so I can unmute while watching someone’s stream, are a chore since I have to wait so long for Discord to do it’s thing. (5+ seconds. This may not sound like much but time it using a timer and imagine waiting that long for every process to load while you’re in a call)Lastly, Discord also seems to be battery hungry.

I know that a lot of people upload stuff, so the fact that it crashes as often as it does is a major concern for me. Another issue is that the app has decided to randomly mark all messages in random chat channels as read when I open them, even though I’ve still got dozens to read before I reach the end of the string. Or I’ll be reading the messages, and suddenly it marked all messages as read, to include ones that happen while I’m reading, and not even remotely caught up. It happens randomly, so I don’t even know what might be the issue. It might happen to a chat every time I open it, or just once in a while but it’s a bug I want to see gone. Being tagged in a message, and then having that indicator removed randomly is an issue. I don’t always have time to read everything in one sitting, so I want to be assured that I can read it later. It is a major issue when it starts you over at the end of the conversation, and doesn’t save from where you had to leave off.

The app doesn’t store your personal information, and only people you approve as contacts can message you.

But having the option to fix typos and misspellings is so key.3. Chat color choices - offer more than just light green bubble choices. Offer a wide range of colors (including gradients) as a fun feature that allows for customization. 4. Reactions - allow a set of reactions to messages including heart, thumbs up and down, and possibly some basic emojis.

Oh, and users have been asking for it for years: the developers clearly aren't very responsive to their client base.  Other than that, your choice of views are dim gray text on a white background or white text on a dark gray background.  Both are hard to read, especially if you have vision problems or are using night filters on your device.  Text cannot be zoomed in on or made larger, making it even harder for people with less-than-perfect eyesight to read. With the other problems listed for the text, if you have to use Dischord, you basically have to use speech-to-text to type and have your device read the incoming messages. Not ideal if you're trying to have a private chat in a public place.  Finally, there's no notification on the app icon telling you that you have messages waiting for you, so you have to open the app to check.

Now, I can’t use the search option which I use (and I cannot stress this enough) frequently. The calls are my biggest issue, though. It opens a new unclosable tab on my phone which is always on “connecting...” and they actually show up on my call log/call history; the whole reason I called my friends via discord was because it didn’t show up on my log and I think there should be an option to hide that.

I was writing some stuff in the chat (to see if she got anything) and when she came back she told me she wasnt getting any either! I think this is because we both muted the chat ""until you turn it back on"". Please fix this, I really like this app! I even re-downloaded it and logged into my account but I still didn't get any.

Also it’s just annoying every time it takes me to the other app. It’s just as acting like Snapchat and it doesn’t do the best job. I would also recommend having the settings be a little more comfortable and less confusing for everyone thank you. I would also recommend NOT having soooo many “suggestions” it’s so annoying and it’s so crowded. I would also like my feed to NOT RESET every time. it is VERY difficult to find a post when almost nothing is in order and TOO MANY suggested posts appear!! I would also like an option to be able to delete EVERY SINGLE post. It would also be MORE comfortable(in my opinion)to have the RESHARED POSTS be on a different category to posts I ACTUALLY made. Because seriously it doesn’t make sense!!! My feed is a mess and honestly idk if it’s because I haven’t been on the app much but please being on the app is sometimes is irritating.

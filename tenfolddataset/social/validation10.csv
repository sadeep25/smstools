WhatsApp has a number of advanced security features. It has end-to-end encryption, just like Apple’s iMessage and Signal. All messages flowing through the platform are secured so that only the sender and the recipient can view them. WhatsApp couldn’t read your message even if it wanted to. The app doesn’t store your personal information, and only people you approve as contacts can message you. As with an increasing number of internet services like Google and Facebook, WhatsApp uses two-factor authentication, which has you type in a second passcode sent to your phone via text message to access your account.

After the call integration update,- I drop calls more easily due to it being difficult to navigate outside of the app whilst staying in call. - I have a hard time returning to discord using the “touch to return to call” banner because it takes me to the actual iPhone call screen which just says “Discord Audio Connecting...” even if I’m already in call. - If i get another call on my iPhone, it kicks me out of the discord call (I was able to stay in the call before) and it’s difficult to get back in. Furthermore, if my phone call is longer than five minutes, the user I’m in call with gets kicked out as a result of me being kicked out of the call. Additionally, In an older update the “iPhone/Speaker” function for choosing if you want your call on speaker or just to be normal volume. Even if I turn my volume all the way down on my phone, it’s so loud that everyone around me can hear because it’s just on speaker by default and I can no longer change it. Really unfortunate and forces me to use some other method to contact people when I am in public. Discord is my favorite social media app to use both on pc and mobile and the downsliding of the quality on mobile is just very frustrating and disappointing. I hope this is addressed soon.","Additionally, In an older update the “iPhone/Speaker” function for choosing if you want your call on speaker or just to be normal volume.",2,True,general,speaker,102.0,109.0,positive,4

It’s great, and even on the occasions there’s a problem, the devs tend to fix it rapidly with surprising speed. I use Discord to Role-play a lot, in fact it’s become my favorite pass time for the last year or so. The only thing I kind of wish was a bit better, is the character limit.As a member of a few role-play servers I find myself often constricted by the 2000 character limit, especially considering I tend to write out 10K+ messages in google docs that I then post for characters that I role-play. As I’m sure is obvious, when I do several of these posts an hour the process of copying and pasting fragments of the messages becomes tedious. Not something that I generally hate, because with how wonderful discord servers are, allowing for many channels to be set up in ways that allow role-play servers to set up several settings, the limited characters per message is far outweighed in my preference. But, in a future update, if at all possible, I’m sure I, and the large amount of Novella Role-play members would certainly enjoy and appreciate an extended or unlimited message character limit.","The only thing I kind of wish was a bit better, is the character limit.",5,True,usability,character limit,56.0,71.0,positive,8

One of the more recent updates, however, made it so when someone called you through the app, it would act as a phone call on your phone. This is an issue with maybe privacy, but also while you’re using the app. Since calls are so spammable in DMs or Group DMs, the call screen will appear on your phone and disappear rapidly. While on the calling screen, you cannot do anything other than accept or decline the call. This is an issue because that basically makes it so if someone spam calls you, you can’t do anything until they stop. If you go to block them, it will take much too long. Other than this issue, the developers are pretty good about fixing bugs within the app. Also, if I’m listening to music when I join a call and then leave, my music will have messed up audio after.","One of the more recent updates, however, made it so when someone called you through the app, it would act as a phone call on your phone.",4,True,efficiency,recent update,17.0,30.0,positive,2

I’ve met so many amazing friends from servers and just through mutual friendships that had already existed. It helped me get through a lot of quarantine knowing that I had people to talk to and had a  reason to get up everyday. I could share and discuss different sorts of interests I had like gaming and anime. I could even create my own custom servers where I could toggle around the settings and fixture it to my own liking. There are just so many endless possibilities and opportunities on discord that I don’t think I could get anywhere else so easily and helpfully. I 100% recommend getting discord if you wanna socialize with people just like you or wanna call up some buds to game with. Discord is definitely the app that I think highlighted majority of the year and I hope it does for the most part too in everyone else’s shoes.,I could even create my own custom servers where I could toggle around the settings and fixture it to my own liking.,5,True,efficiency,server,35.0,41.0,positive,2

I’m a gamer and most of the times I try to make friends with people on Snapchat or iMessage and stuff. But they’re not gamers so we don’t really get along well. One of my friends told me about discord! It was a chatting app for GAMERS!!! And when I got it, I loved the design of the app, how it works, the people, AND YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR NAME TO ANYTHING!!! Because your 4 digits will be different than the other people who has the same user. I love it! And also, you can call! :O you can also send photos! Videos! The best part is that none of your text messages gets censored. For an example, if I say: “OMG SHUT UP LMAOO 😂😂” it doesn’t it censored.

Discord’s developers are amazing people who actually listen to their users, unlike many other mainstream services. They make changes to their app immediately when it’s needed, like the increase in caller limit for the  coronavirus pandemic. But, the best thing they do is admit that they were wrong. When discord releases a new feature and the public doesn’t use it all that much or it doesn’t work like it’s supposed to, they don’t send out hundreds of updates to fix it, ultimately making it worse. Instead, they admit that it wasn’t a good thing to add and they remove it.

If there could be a way for iPhone users to use their emotes without having to type it out, it’ll be nice.

For example, you can't change privacy settings to turn off DMs on a certain server, which can be a struggle for people with, uh, fans.  Another thing is that you can't change somebody's role on mobile, which is very aggravating. I'm a moderator on a server and we have a specific role to give to misbehaving people which prevents them from sending messages.  But, I can only do my job as moderator if I'm on my PC, because mobile won't let me change roles.  In addition, for whatever reason, certain pictures refuse to upload, and it’s not the channel settings because it’s only with certain pictures (only on mobile).  The last thing I recommend, which is currently neither on mobile or PC, is having some version of read receipts for DMs.  I know that's probably gonna be controversial, but I personally know that some of my friends are big YouTubers, so they get caught up, and forget.

This worked great until shortly before Thanksgiving. We have discovered that the Facebook app now only allows the sound for live videos to come from the microphone of the device being used for the video. Ugh!

I was informed by my receiving parties that the voice clarity, volume, and lossless transmission was significantly better using FreeTone. Also, as the name implies, it is free to use and easy to setup, even if you don't have an IT background.So, before you head off into the boonies, if you anticipate the need or desire to make or receive phone calls or text messages, take the time to sign up with FreeTone. My second choice is Line2 as it handles call screening, handling, and/or forwarding with a very user friendly GUI We just got back from Sea Ranch, near Gualala, and once again FreeTone was the best quality even on the really poorly configured wifi that was being stomped on by a neighbor on the same channel...So add a portable pocket sized wifi access point/router and you will cover all bases!I would give it a 5 star rating except the call handling is inferior to Line2.","I was informed by my receiving parties that the voice clarity, volume, and lossless transmission was significantly better using FreeTone.",4,True,efficiency,volume,64.0,70.0,positive,2

Channels with embeds take extremely long to load, and joining voice channels lags to the point of not being usable.(2) Crashes - This app CONSTANTLY crashes.

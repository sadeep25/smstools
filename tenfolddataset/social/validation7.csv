However, there are some features on PC that you can just not access on mobile.  For example, you can't change privacy settings to turn off DMs on a certain server, which can be a struggle for people with, uh, fans.  Another thing is that you can't change somebody's role on mobile, which is very aggravating. I'm a moderator on a server and we have a specific role to give to misbehaving people which prevents them from sending messages.  But, I can only do my job as moderator if I'm on my PC, because mobile won't let me change roles.  In addition, for whatever reason, certain pictures refuse to upload, and it‚Äôs not the channel settings because it‚Äôs only with certain pictures (only on mobile).  The last thing I recommend, which is currently neither on mobile or PC, is having some version of read receipts for DMs.  I know that's probably gonna be controversial, but I personally know that some of my friends are big YouTubers, so they get caught up, and forget.  However, if I was able to tell if they'd read my message, I'd be able to yell at ‚Äî er, uh, talk to them about it.","For example, you can't change privacy settings to turn off DMs on a certain server, which can be a struggle for people with, uh, fans.",4,True,general,server,77.0,83.0,negative,4

Volume sliders on everybody giving me peace of mind on how loud (or quiet) people are being, being able to voice/text mute people that are being abusive in chat, and having multiple text/voice channels is just icing on the cake.I told myself I wouldn‚Äôt write a review for Discord till they rolled out with the video call/screenshare update on PC, and they did so here I am.

It‚Äôs an easy to understand usage, for me, and simple to join servers. And the ability to create various rooms for various things also is good and creative as it allows for different topics to be shared. However, despite the amazing things the team has done, the mobile is still equivalent to urinating into an anthill. It‚Äôs difficult to get started, and when you‚Äôre using it there are always issues while doing it. When in a discord call in a Server, it works fine for a portion of the time in it. However at some point, the app stops allowing voice chat the moment I leave and look at memes or other things. And it only begins again when I go back in,Ultimately resulting in me having to restart the app. Second, when using discord, while in a call, the screen will suddenly shut off, but the phone will not and not turn the screen on unless hitting the power button or waiting for brief flashes of the screen. This is increasingly angering as I talk to my friends, trying to share memes, or other things and my screen is refusing to work. Please pay more attention to the mobile version, to make it equal to the laptop version, as it is difficult and a struggle to use.

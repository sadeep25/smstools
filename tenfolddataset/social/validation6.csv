But the mobile version is missing quite a few important features. For example, Discord on mobile (possibly IOS only) doesn't have Audit Logs for server moderation. Audit Logs are very important for server moderation, so that is one flaw with the mobile app. Also, only a minor setback this is, is the fact that there is no emote button on the mobile app. Yes, you can easily tap the emoji button on your keyboard, but if you are in a server with global emotes, you have to type out the names of the emote. But, there is emote prediction, making this a minor set back. Finally, I want to mention this weird bug that happens sometimes; It is a bug when you can't join Voice Channels or Voice Calls; it just disconnects you automatically, and it does this for a loop. When you close the app and retry, the same results will happen. You usually have to wait hours before you can join a Voice Channel or Voice Call again. Thank you for making such a wonderful app! These setbacks can be overlooked, so Discord is STILL my main way of contacting friends.","For example, Discord on mobile (possibly IOS only) doesn't have Audit Logs for server moderation.",4,True,general,server,80.0,86.0,negative,4

It seems to me that when one is making a new post.  The text box should occupy the majority of the screen. One feature I would like to see is the ability to mark all notifications as read as one can do on a laptop version.I would also like to find someway to ensure that people can be exposed to different points of view. I fear that we all will be getting posts that we agree with if the feed is filled with posts that are similar to ones that we have liked in the past.

It has an amazing and simple UI, and it works well on all my devices. The moderation side of things is well-thought out too. I own a server with my friends to talk on while gaming, and it is easy to add new roles for people. The bots in discord are good as well, because you can use them to play music, look things up, and more. Also, discord is a good way to chat with strangers and meet new people, without giving out your phone number. And as a final touch, discord‚Äôs sense of humor is great. It feels like there are no Easter eggs or humor in any software/apps these days, but discord is different: it has a friendly interface, with many features implemented that are funny. Overall, discord is an amazing chat platform.

This was auto-downloaded, added to my photo library, and then auto-transferred to another photo library.

I run a group where I am a big advocate of scheduled posts. I post about 15 times per day using this method and schedule my posts out a month at a time, and then go in and move things around as needed. Sometime between the last time I managed my groups posts a week ago and today the scheduled posts option in the group disappeared. Now I have to go on the desktop site on my computer, scroll through about 200 posts, reschedule a single post, the page refreshes, and then I have to scroll through 200 posts again to edit the next one. Previously the app would allow me to make all of my edits, and then refresh all at once and check to make sure everything was good. I could edit 100+ posts and only refresh and scroll through all my posts once or twice. This update just killed my group because now I‚Äôm no longer interested in scheduling the posts, and I don‚Äôt have time to make the posts daily which is why I scheduled them in the first place. I downloaded the new Facebook creator studio and it only supports pages, not groups.","I downloaded the new Facebook creator studio and it only supports pages, not groups.",1,True,usability,page,67.0,71.0,negative,8

I am not as computer savvy but will continue to try and reveal & try to locate him. Even if he’s never prosecuted I believe the shame amongst his brethren would punish him as deserved.

You can do some exploring and find servers that you like and/or find new interests! As an example I took up knitting as an inspiration to make a gift for an online friend. Though Discord does have safety and privacy settings, it is wise to keep your personal information to yourself while talking with online friends. Discord will not leak your information to any of your friends or anyone at all, so it’s entirely up to you if you want to share anything (such as time zones). I don’t recommend sharing personal information, especially when you’ve just met them. Be careful when messaging unknown users.Again, I love Discord and would definitely recommend it.

One of the more recent updates, however, made it so when someone called you through the app, it would act as a phone call on your phone. This is an issue with maybe privacy, but also while you’re using the app. Since calls are so spammable in DMs or Group DMs, the call screen will appear on your phone and disappear rapidly. While on the calling screen, you cannot do anything other than accept or decline the call. This is an issue because that basically makes it so if someone spam calls you, you can’t do anything until they stop. If you go to block them, it will take much too long. Other than this issue, the developers are pretty good about fixing bugs within the app. Also, if I’m listening to music when I join a call and then leave, my music will have messed up audio after.","Also, if I’m listening to music when I join a call and then leave, my music will have messed up audio after.",4,True,effectiveness,music,27.0,32.0,negative,1

After all these years, I'm still irked by not having the freedom of creating and affixing my own style-stamp for chats.  That 'creative freedom', as an option, is as fundementally necessary to express myself as is the message it contains. Another vein of increasing public necessity is encryption for video, chat, calls, etcetera. Both suggestions are an easy addition.Oh.

However, despite the amazing things the team has done, the mobile is still equivalent to urinating into an anthill. It’s difficult to get started, and when you’re using it there are always issues while doing it. When in a discord call in a Server, it works fine for a portion of the time in it. However at some point, the app stops allowing voice chat the moment I leave and look at memes or other things. And it only begins again when I go back in,Ultimately resulting in me having to restart the app. Second, when using discord, while in a call, the screen will suddenly shut off, but the phone will not and not turn the screen on unless hitting the power button or waiting for brief flashes of the screen. This is increasingly angering as I talk to my friends, trying to share memes, or other things and my screen is refusing to work.

Now you have to enter the music app and press play so you can keep listening to the song. I don’t really like that.

It’s an easy to understand usage, for me, and simple to join servers. And the ability to create various rooms for various things also is good and creative as it allows for different topics to be shared. However, despite the amazing things the team has done, the mobile is still equivalent to urinating into an anthill. It’s difficult to get started, and when you’re using it there are always issues while doing it. When in a discord call in a Server, it works fine for a portion of the time in it. However at some point, the app stops allowing voice chat the moment I leave and look at memes or other things. And it only begins again when I go back in,Ultimately resulting in me having to restart the app. Second, when using discord, while in a call, the screen will suddenly shut off, but the phone will not and not turn the screen on unless hitting the power button or waiting for brief flashes of the screen. This is increasingly angering as I talk to my friends, trying to share memes, or other things and my screen is refusing to work.

I highly doubt my phone is the problem (iPhone 6) bc all the notifications are on and I’m getting notifications from private dms. The server settings have been the same since I’ve joined them but I have muted certain channels from time to time.

As frequent gamers, it’s a very useful app when it comes to communication. I used to use it on PC all the time and it was fantastic. Due to certain personal circumstances however, I no longer have access to a PC. Luckily I was able to get discord on mobile. However, I was very disappointed when I found out how terrible it was for mobile. It kills my battery life, overheats my phone, and hogs all my bandwidth so I can’t really do much else when I’m in a group call. What makes it worse is that I actually have a good phone. My phone model is an iPhone X. It’s very disappointing that an app as popular and widely used as discord has not yet been optimized for usage on mobile. I’m hoping an update will be pushed forward soon to minimize the battery and bandwidth that discord uses.

The most recent being this—if I’ve commented on a status, and then in turn another friend did as well, I can’t see the comment. I’ll click on the notification and get taken to the status, but it won’t show me any comments.With the start of these random glitches, I thought that maybe I needed to update the app. Nope. All up to date. And it seems like there’s a new issue popping up each week. Like I can’t search for posts in a group I’m in (like in the search bar) so that I can revisit the post. It won’t let me select it. If someone likes a comment, it doesn’t show up (but the notification that it happened does). So, not sure what’s going on, but I’m getting more and more annoyed with this particular platform.

Often times you cannot recreate the moment or verbalize exactly the way you did in the previous message that very inconveniently jumps into the bin.

I am not as computer savvy but will continue to try and reveal & try to locate him. Even if he’s never prosecuted I believe the shame amongst his brethren would punish him as deserved.

You can do some exploring and find servers that you like and/or find new interests! As an example I took up knitting as an inspiration to make a gift for an online friend. Though Discord does have safety and privacy settings, it is wise to keep your personal information to yourself while talking with online friends. Discord will not leak your information to any of your friends or anyone at all, so it’s entirely up to you if you want to share anything (such as time zones). I don’t recommend sharing personal information, especially when you’ve just met them. Be careful when messaging unknown users.Again, I love Discord and would definitely recommend it.

One of the more recent updates, however, made it so when someone called you through the app, it would act as a phone call on your phone. This is an issue with maybe privacy, but also while you’re using the app. Since calls are so spammable in DMs or Group DMs, the call screen will appear on your phone and disappear rapidly. While on the calling screen, you cannot do anything other than accept or decline the call. This is an issue because that basically makes it so if someone spam calls you, you can’t do anything until they stop. If you go to block them, it will take much too long. Other than this issue, the developers are pretty good about fixing bugs within the app. Also, if I’m listening to music when I join a call and then leave, my music will have messed up audio after.","Also, if I’m listening to music when I join a call and then leave, my music will have messed up audio after.",4,True,effectiveness,music,27.0,32.0,negative,1

After all these years, I'm still irked by not having the freedom of creating and affixing my own style-stamp for chats.  That 'creative freedom', as an option, is as fundementally necessary to express myself as is the message it contains. Another vein of increasing public necessity is encryption for video, chat, calls, etcetera. Both suggestions are an easy addition.Oh.

However, despite the amazing things the team has done, the mobile is still equivalent to urinating into an anthill.

However at some point, the app stops allowing voice chat the moment I leave and look at memes or other things. And it only begins again when I go back in,Ultimately resulting in me having to restart the app. Second, when using discord, while in a call, the screen will suddenly shut off, but the phone will not and not turn the screen on unless hitting the power button or waiting for brief flashes of the screen. This is increasingly angering as I talk to my friends, trying to share memes, or other things and my screen is refusing to work.

It’s an easy to understand usage, for me, and simple to join servers. And the ability to create various rooms for various things also is good and creative as it allows for different topics to be shared. However, despite the amazing things the team has done, the mobile is still equivalent to urinating into an anthill. It’s difficult to get started, and when you’re using it there are always issues while doing it. When in a discord call in a Server, it works fine for a portion of the time in it. However at some point, the app stops allowing voice chat the moment I leave and look at memes or other things. And it only begins again when I go back in,Ultimately resulting in me having to restart the app. Second, when using discord, while in a call, the screen will suddenly shut off, but the phone will not and not turn the screen on unless hitting the power button or waiting for brief flashes of the screen. This is increasingly angering as I talk to my friends, trying to share memes, or other things and my screen is refusing to work.

And it’s not because the employees and staff working at discord are mean, or anything, it’s because of the nature of the setup discord chooses to use. Essentially when you join a server, the guidelines you have are the ones the owner sets for you. Larger servers are often governed by mods. But the problem is that these mods generally don’t have too many qualifications to be a moderator. And when the mods are ineffective at creating a safe environment, that’s when toxic behavior thrives. Discord does have some policies, on its ToS but these are generally very simple rules, and are few and far between. I’ve had many terrible experiences on servers where toxic behavior is present and the mods either do nothing about it or they take the wrong course of action. Now this isn’t something discord has much control over, but rather design of the website in it’s entirety is flawed. I wouldn’t recommend this app to people who who are not in a healthy state of mind, or to anyone in general. However I guess discord works for some people and if you find that this style of social media works for you then by all means download it.

I guess you could say I miss the simplicity of the chat box. Also, the movement of the it when you click into the text box versus when you click out glitches on me and makes the whole app slow when switching between chats, channels, or servers. Everything lags behind and it gets to be pretty annoying. One thing I absolutely love, though, is that when you type something, but let’s say your phone dies (like mine did twice), Discord saves what you wrote in the chat box! I have been saved so many times by that feature. Discord is a great app and I use it for so many things, but I also write a lot on it, so what I wrote affects me the way it might not affect others. The 2,000 character limit can get a bit irritating, too, so I wish there was a way you could switch the limit off, but I’ve found ways to work around it so it’s not an immediate issue.

It does an amazing job at keeping notifications hidden when you want them to be.But I cannot say the same for calls. Recently, Discord started integrating their calls with actual phone calls. This means that every time I get called on Discord, it goes through to my ringtone. The whole reason I use Discord is to keep my online life separate from my personal life. Although there is a setting that allows you to disable this feature, I still get the ringtone. Whenever I get called on Discord, even though the app is closed, I still get a ringtone. I even have all notifications turned off in my settings. The ringtone only lasts about 2 seconds before it realizes that it should not be there, but it gets pretty annoying, since it forces me to stop whatever i’m doing on my phone.What annoys me the most is that this issue has been fixed before. The previous update had the setting that disabled the integrated phone calls, but it actually did its job, unlike this recent update. I had no calls going through no matter how much I was getting spammed with calls. I thought this problem would be gone forever, but it still managed to find its way back.

After the call integration update,- I drop calls more easily due to it being difficult to navigate outside of the app whilst staying in call. - I have a hard time returning to discord using the “touch to return to call” banner because it takes me to the actual iPhone call screen which just says “Discord Audio Connecting...” even if I’m already in call. - If i get another call on my iPhone, it kicks me out of the discord call (I was able to stay in the call before) and it’s difficult to get back in. Furthermore, if my phone call is longer than five minutes, the user I’m in call with gets kicked out as a result of me being kicked out of the call. Additionally, In an older update the “iPhone/Speaker” function for choosing if you want your call on speaker or just to be normal volume. Even if I turn my volume all the way down on my phone, it’s so loud that everyone around me can hear because it’s just on speaker by default and I can no longer change it. Really unfortunate and forces me to use some other method to contact people when I am in public. Discord is my favorite social media app to use both on pc and mobile and the downsliding of the quality on mobile is just very frustrating and disappointing.

It was bad before, it’s worse now. There is still no support for any functionality with earbud button interaction like a mute toggle or end-call. AttenuationThis “feature” has never been satisfactory on this app. Currently, attenuation is maxed (5% volume) and held there as long as the app is running. Even if you mute volume in Discord, sound reduction exists. It is clearly NOT attenuation but rather full volume limitation of other apps.Top BarThe Discord app keeps a notification bar active full time and it is “always on top” therefore getting in the way. A great example is the fact that I almost forgot to add this complaint, but the bar was in the way of the “send” button to post the review. Phone-calls crash appThe worst thing about this app is when it crashes when you get a call. Note that it crashed when you receive the call, even if you don’t answer the it. The app must be shut down and restarted manually every time you get a call. Unacceptable.

I did everything as I was told: I sent in a review request and they fixed the problem, unflagging my ads account, so they sent me an email to confirm that all was well again. However, I cannot access either my account or my page anymore. It’s as if they don’t exist. Apparently the problem was already fixed but I can’t see anything I previously put on my account and page.Furthermore, I can’t make a new account because my email is tied to my previous account, so I’m pretty much stuck.

I know that a lot of people upload stuff, so the fact that it crashes as often as it does is a major concern for me. Another issue is that the app has decided to randomly mark all messages in random chat channels as read when I open them, even though I’ve still got dozens to read before I reach the end of the string. Or I’ll be reading the messages, and suddenly it marked all messages as read, to include ones that happen while I’m reading, and not even remotely caught up. It happens randomly, so I don’t even know what might be the issue. It might happen to a chat every time I open it, or just once in a while but it’s a bug I want to see gone. Being tagged in a message, and then having that indicator removed randomly is an issue. I don’t always have time to read everything in one sitting, so I want to be assured that I can read it later.

Us non-speaker users didn’t want the function being entirely taken away, but just have the ability to switch between the two. Another thing to note is that the call ends when you lock your phone, this is honestly VERY annoying. Before this was not a problem, even before the speaker-only era.

I’ve used the app daily for over 2 years now and overall it’s so much better than things like Skype and I’ve met many new friends. However, the most recent update released today (May 11,2019) there are some things I just really dislike a lot. First off, they moved the search button feature and I used that a lot so now I accidentally start calls and would really prefer (at the very least) the option to move it back. Second, calls now come up as an actual phone call and show in recent phone logs. It also opens a new tab that is uncloseable and seems to be always on “connecting...” even though I can hear my friend and my friend can hear me clearly. I can’t close this secondary “phone” tab without ending the call and it’s really frustrating and I’m really hoping you guys will revert the call settings to how it used to be. On another note, just a mild annoyance, when calls now start, it automatically plays audio on speaker and I wish there was a way to switch it to the private call setting. Hope these issues get fixed, otherwise I’ll have to take a break from using such a great app.","However, the most recent update released today (May 11,2019) there are some things I just really dislike a lot.",2,True,effectiveness,recent update,19.0,32.0,negative,1

I looked online and apparently sometimes Discord can be “down” (Which is bizarre. I’ve had it with Snapchat too.) which is very disappointing to me.

I’ve noticed that I have the same account in TextMe and FreeTone, one app being on iPad and the other on iPhone (both apps work on iPhone and iPad). The same chosen virtual numbers, call history and messages, number of credits purchased, and the same userID, which the derive from the parting of the email address before @. So, to avoid confusion, I logged out from TextMe and meant to delete it. !!! I was shocked to find out that I was also logged out on FreeTone and when I tried to relogin on FreeTone, it told me that my account doesn’t exit.

(It’s independently documented.)There is no ability to contact support through the app, at least without account.

And for all users, better stay away from these schemers. There is number of the same apps which work more reliably and are honest, while this one would end up steeling your money. I have used for years and highly recommend the following alternatives:1. Sideline (can work via Wi-Fi and via cellular network, i.e. in a “calling card” mode, but you receive calls too. Extremely useful is you happen to be away from Wi-Fi)    It pays for U.S. calls with ads, but you can block all adds on iPhone/iPad (not just in Safari) with AdGuard, Adblocker Mobile and number of others2. Dingtone and and TalkU (also from the same developer, but features are different and they work independently).3. TextFree voiceNot to mention Skype, which supports many virtual call out numbers, and you get 60 international minutes free every month, if you pay for $98 for MS Office, plus 1T on OneDriveOr Google HangOuts, just first set up Google Voice and get a virtual number. They charge $20 (I think) for changing the number, so it’s not a “burner number” app, neither are those I have mentioned here. Even burner apps charge for a new number.FreeTone and TextMe, though, are malware with two heads, to steel your credits purchased for money.

I’m talking constantly freezing, crashing and just taking forever to load stuff and even send messages. When I open a large server is when things get real crazy. Sometimes I have to wait 2 min just to switch to a different server. Not sure if this is a problem with older phones since I a using an IPhone 5s which isn’t exactly the greatest.

And it’s not because the employees and staff working at discord are mean, or anything, it’s because of the nature of the setup discord chooses to use. Essentially when you join a server, the guidelines you have are the ones the owner sets for you. Larger servers are often governed by mods. But the problem is that these mods generally don’t have too many qualifications to be a moderator. And when the mods are ineffective at creating a safe environment, that’s when toxic behavior thrives. Discord does have some policies, on its ToS but these are generally very simple rules, and are few and far between. I’ve had many terrible experiences on servers where toxic behavior is present and the mods either do nothing about it or they take the wrong course of action. Now this isn’t something discord has much control over, but rather design of the website in it’s entirety is flawed. I wouldn’t recommend this app to people who who are not in a healthy state of mind, or to anyone in general. However I guess discord works for some people and if you find that this style of social media works for you then by all means download it.

It does an amazing job at keeping notifications hidden when you want them to be.But I cannot say the same for calls. Recently, Discord started integrating their calls with actual phone calls. This means that every time I get called on Discord, it goes through to my ringtone. The whole reason I use Discord is to keep my online life separate from my personal life. Although there is a setting that allows you to disable this feature, I still get the ringtone. Whenever I get called on Discord, even though the app is closed, I still get a ringtone. I even have all notifications turned off in my settings. The ringtone only lasts about 2 seconds before it realizes that it should not be there, but it gets pretty annoying, since it forces me to stop whatever i’m doing on my phone.What annoys me the most is that this issue has been fixed before. The previous update had the setting that disabled the integrated phone calls, but it actually did its job, unlike this recent update. I had no calls going through no matter how much I was getting spammed with calls. I thought this problem would be gone forever, but it still managed to find its way back.

While on the calling screen, you cannot do anything other than accept or decline the call. This is an issue because that basically makes it so if someone spam calls you, you can’t do anything until they stop. If you go to block them, it will take much too long.

For example, we have an emote of a cat named henk, so when I would want to use it, I’d have to type :henk:. Now we have a lot of emotes and it’s difficult to remember the name of every single one. If there could be a way for iPhone users to use their emotes without having to type it out, it’ll be nice. If there could also be a way for phone users to create emotes through their phones instead of uploading it to their computer that’ll make things a bit more simple.

The only description I was given was that I “was found sending threats to others, participating in targeted harassment, or inciting violence against individuals or communities”.  I demanded to see proof of these claims and was denied the proof.  Instead, they told me they “reviewed the case and would not be reinstating my account”.  So, new users beware.

It was bad before, it’s worse now. There is still no support for any functionality with earbud button interaction like a mute toggle or end-call. AttenuationThis “feature” has never been satisfactory on this app. Currently, attenuation is maxed (5% volume) and held there as long as the app is running. Even if you mute volume in Discord, sound reduction exists. It is clearly NOT attenuation but rather full volume limitation of other apps.Top BarThe Discord app keeps a notification bar active full time and it is “always on top” therefore getting in the way. A great example is the fact that I almost forgot to add this complaint, but the bar was in the way of the “send” button to post the review. Phone-calls crash appThe worst thing about this app is when it crashes when you get a call. Note that it crashed when you receive the call, even if you don’t answer the it. The app must be shut down and restarted manually every time you get a call. Unacceptable.

I called Char Broil and explained why I needed to return the grill. I thought it would be partially assembled. They refused to take it back because I should have known how it would be packaged. They did not care about any health concerns I had about shopping in a store and were not responsible for how Fed Ex delivered it. They said it was my responsibility to find someone to move it to my deck and put it together. For the past 20 years I have had nothing but Char Broil Grills at my home but I always bought them from Walmart’s  or Lowe’s with a return policy.  I have learned a hard lesson.

But, there is emote prediction, making this a minor set back. Finally, I want to mention this weird bug that happens sometimes; It is a bug when you can't join Voice Channels or Voice Calls; it just disconnects you automatically, and it does this for a loop. When you close the app and retry, the same results will happen. You usually have to wait hours before you can join a Voice Channel or Voice Call again. Thank you for making such a wonderful app!

After I finally got in to set it up, it wouldn’t take my birthday. I would enter it and it would disappear after the menu collapsed. After a few days of trying to figure it out, I got in. After that, I tried sharing a photo that I took on my iPhone (HEIC file) but it doesn’t just show the photo like Slack, Twitter, Facebook, or literally any other site like this would. It posts it as a file and when you click on the file in Discord, it opens a web browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.) and forced downloads the file to your device, all before you even have a chance to view it.

I’ve re-downloaded the app numerous times since then and still, no success logging in. Luckily, my browser still works and I use that to chat with my clan.

I’ve used the app daily for over 2 years now and overall it’s so much better than things like Skype and I’ve met many new friends. However, the most recent update released today (May 11,2019) there are some things I just really dislike a lot. First off, they moved the search button feature and I used that a lot so now I accidentally start calls and would really prefer (at the very least) the option to move it back. Second, calls now come up as an actual phone call and show in recent phone logs. It also opens a new tab that is uncloseable and seems to be always on “connecting...” even though I can hear my friend and my friend can hear me clearly. I can’t close this secondary “phone” tab without ending the call and it’s really frustrating and I’m really hoping you guys will revert the call settings to how it used to be. On another note, just a mild annoyance, when calls now start, it automatically plays audio on speaker and I wish there was a way to switch it to the private call setting. Hope these issues get fixed, otherwise I’ll have to take a break from using such a great app.","Second, calls now come up as an actual phone call and show in recent phone logs.",2,True,usability,phone call,40.0,50.0,positive,8

One of the more recent updates, however, made it so when someone called you through the app, it would act as a phone call on your phone. This is an issue with maybe privacy, but also while you’re using the app. Since calls are so spammable in DMs or Group DMs, the call screen will appear on your phone and disappear rapidly. While on the calling screen, you cannot do anything other than accept or decline the call. This is an issue because that basically makes it so if someone spam calls you, you can’t do anything until they stop. If you go to block them, it will take much too long.

This happens once every couple of days. Not to mention the big tech censorship. I stumbled upon a post from trump, and someone made a point that was so absurdly stupid that I just had to respond (I’m independent) he called trump names like an incompetent blob, but when I responded by using his point against him and calling him a mamook, I got a 30 DAY POST BAN! A WHOLE MONTH! Yet whenever someone calls the president names it’s completely fine. Mark Zuckerberg if you see this, the only reason I still use this sorry excuse of an app is because there’s family that I connect with on here that I don’t have that option anywhere else.

Also I really get annoyed of people complaining about changes to the app! Just because you are not used to it does not mean it’s bad. Especially when discord wants to make the phone app more like a phone app then a desktop app, they want to adapt the app to the platform it is on. So, please stop complaining and think about all factors!

For example, we have an emote of a cat named henk, so when I would want to use it, I’d have to type :henk:. Now we have a lot of emotes and it’s difficult to remember the name of every single one. If there could be a way for iPhone users to use their emotes without having to type it out, it’ll be nice. If there could also be a way for phone users to create emotes through their phones instead of uploading it to their computer that’ll make things a bit more simple.

However, there are some features on PC that you can just not access on mobile.  For example, you can't change privacy settings to turn off DMs on a certain server, which can be a struggle for people with, uh, fans.  Another thing is that you can't change somebody's role on mobile, which is very aggravating. I'm a moderator on a server and we have a specific role to give to misbehaving people which prevents them from sending messages.  But, I can only do my job as moderator if I'm on my PC, because mobile won't let me change roles.  In addition, for whatever reason, certain pictures refuse to upload, and it’s not the channel settings because it’s only with certain pictures (only on mobile).  The last thing I recommend, which is currently neither on mobile or PC, is having some version of read receipts for DMs.  I know that's probably gonna be controversial, but I personally know that some of my friends are big YouTubers, so they get caught up, and forget.  However, if I was able to tell if they'd read my message, I'd be able to yell at — er, uh, talk to them about it.","For example, you can't change privacy settings to turn off DMs on a certain server, which can be a struggle for people with, uh, fans.",4,True,general,server,77.0,83.0,negative,4

For now I’ll add a star for the fix. REVIEW 11/17I’ve had this app (and it’s oddly confusing identical twin app TextMe) for several years now and it’s been a constant headache. Never kept such an unreliable app on my iPad and I would dump it if I had not invested money into credits and had so much history with the phone number. Their development team seem incapable of responding to iOS updates as every time Apple pushes out a major upgrade the app breaks. To compound matters, their support staff are the most dim witted and clueless team on the planet. They can rarely sort problems out, and if they do it takes days of messaging back and forth. Hopeless. If only Skype did SMS. I’ve tried a few other text and call apps and they all seem pretty poor. After trying several some years ago I settled on FreeTone and boy do I regret it.

You can do that. Change your display name for only one, specific server? You can do that too. But for me the most valuable thing about Discord is the sense of community that you feel almost immediately after logging on. Depending on your server choices you’ll almost always have an unread message, meaning there’s almost always something or someone for you to come back to. And if you don’t want to be bothered? Turn off notifications for servers and channels you don’t want to hear from. Not once have I had a security issue or even fear that I would lose personal information.

The only downside to WhatsApp is that when you lose your device or are out of storage and uninstall the app, you typically lose all your previous chats and data.

It’s an easy to understand usage, for me, and simple to join servers. And the ability to create various rooms for various things also is good and creative as it allows for different topics to be shared. However, despite the amazing things the team has done, the mobile is still equivalent to urinating into an anthill. It’s difficult to get started, and when you’re using it there are always issues while doing it. When in a discord call in a Server, it works fine for a portion of the time in it. However at some point, the app stops allowing voice chat the moment I leave and look at memes or other things. And it only begins again when I go back in,Ultimately resulting in me having to restart the app. Second, when using discord, while in a call, the screen will suddenly shut off, but the phone will not and not turn the screen on unless hitting the power button or waiting for brief flashes of the screen. This is increasingly angering as I talk to my friends, trying to share memes, or other things and my screen is refusing to work.

My child is a brand Rep, and it used to be so convenient to make our promotion post and share in 5-10 groups with a few quick taps. Now, I have to individually share the post to each individual group. I understand it is probably some kind of safety feature to prevent hackers and bots and bugs, but it has really made it more difficult for us. Also, the new layout on the computer (not the app, but the physical website) has me all sorts of lost and confused. I’m a pretty tech-y person, but when you move everything from its relative location, it makes it much more difficult of an interface to use. Love the new avatars though!!! They are super fun and cute!!!

Facebook has zero respect for free speech. The only thing worse than Facebook’s “independent fact checkers” is their gross invasion of users privacy. They track your exact location, your website history, and they use the microphone on your phone to record everything that you say. This happens every second your phone is on, regardless of if the app is opened or closed. What do they do with all of this information? They sell it to other companies for a profit, they use it to bombard you with ads that are very specific to you, and God knows what else.

I’ve actually found a group of people that I frequently game with and talk to that I honestly really love. My experience this past year has been really amazing, and without trouble.

When you want to leave a server you’ve created, you have the option to pass ownership to someone you trust or someone that’s qualified. It isn’t the same for group chats, though. If I had created a group chat, and had to leave, I would also want to pass the ability of owner to someone trusted, but it randomly picks a member to make the new owner. As the owner, I think I should be the one making that choice. Because even though I absolutely love my discord friends, some of them tend to abuse the power of owner chaotically, and I don’t want to be added back into that kind of environment.

Honestly, how will Facebook fix my situation now since they aloud this to happen to an account that I use for personal and work use. Again, their policy states “not degrading or shaming other users” and yet they allow it to happen to my account after 2 times I reported it. I will be getting in contact with management and see what happens. But as of now, Facebook is going down hill fast and I highly do not recommend this prejudice platform.","Again, their policy states “not degrading or shaming other users” and yet they allow it to happen to my account after 2 times I reported it.",1,True,security,account,105.0,112.0,negative,7

Apparently I was a “threat” to their community, for being in a server that gave information about the BLM riots. Never had I said anything in the server, let alone threaten somebody. When I made an appeal, they claimed my account would not be given back. When I asked for proof as to how I violated their terms and services, I received NO response. It’s been roughly two weeks since the incident. I lost friends that I only had contact with on discord. I asked Discord Support if they’d at least give me an invite back to the one server with my friends in it. No response. I’m disappointed that they took away my account for no reason, and with no proof, and didn’t even respect me as a customer to answer my email or twitter text message.

After awhile I found it to be a bit too invasive and left. Years later I rejoined again for family reasons. I began to use it for national and international news and political interest as well. Over the years, and especially during this election year, Facebook became increasingly biased against conservative views. The “fact checkers,” engineers and executives seem to work overtime to censor important conservative news and information, to stifle free speech and exchange of information and discourse, and to often shut down members who do not tow some of the leftist political lines, talking points and agendas. I now feel like it is becoming a literal arm of the globalist/socialist/leftist juggernaut which is intent on introducing a controlling groupthink mentality on the world.

Before, it would be a simple notification at the top of my screen, but now it’s the entire thing. One more thing, the calling screen simply doesn’t work. I’ll answer a call, and it will not pick up my mic at all. I have to hang up and rejoin for it to work, which gets annoying after a while.

I re-downloaded the app recently because I was joining a clan and they required discord. I got the app and I was still logged into my old account, which was glitched, so I created a new one. I actually had to create that account on my browser because the app didn’t even let me do that. I created my account and tried to login on the app, no success. I’ve re-downloaded the app numerous times since then and still, no success logging in. Luckily, my browser still works and I use that to chat with my clan. Unfortunately, even when I turn my phone sideways, I can’t see all of the writing because it shows all the members of the group on the right hand side and it takes up half of the screen. Then, I have to read downwards one letter at a time and I don’t have the patience for that, especially with all of the scrolling it requires. If I could get on the app and not have to worry about that, I would have no complaints, but this simple fix is ruining the entire app for me.

Dingtone and and TalkU (also from the same developer, but features are different and they work independently).3. TextFree voiceNot to mention Skype, which supports many virtual call out numbers, and you get 60 international minutes free every month, if you pay for $98 for MS Office, plus 1T on OneDriveOr Google HangOuts, just first set up Google Voice and get a virtual number. They charge $20 (I think) for changing the number, so it’s not a “burner number” app, neither are those I have mentioned here.

For one discord occasionally glitches out making me unable to hear my friends which requires me to completely restart the app.  Which is fine normally but when I’m playing games it’s not always easy to restart discord. Sometimes it leaves and joins the call for no reason, just disconnects and reconnects Atleast 4 times. And occasionally it turns of speaker mode at random.

You can do that. Change your display name for only one, specific server? You can do that too. But for me the most valuable thing about Discord is the sense of community that you feel almost immediately after logging on. Depending on your server choices you’ll almost always have an unread message, meaning there’s almost always something or someone for you to come back to. And if you don’t want to be bothered? Turn off notifications for servers and channels you don’t want to hear from. Not once have I had a security issue or even fear that I would lose personal information. Setting up 2-factor authentication was the easiest security experience I have had in a long time, and if you still have concerns, you won’t be required to even give Discord your phone number,  much less your name and other personal info. When I’m not using the in-built messages app on my phone or tablet, Discord is my #1 default","Change your display name for only one, specific server?",5,True,general,server,49.0,55.0,negative,4

It’s as if they cannot believe anyone would not find the learning curve a joy...... I realize that I am slower than a lot of people to learn things with computer programs. But I also notice that no one in our group, if they do know how to do something, has ever found it easy to explain how to do it to others.......

Shouldn’t this be as simple as adding a new folder in a file system? We’ve been using Discord over 3 years, yet no current member can figure out how to do this......

I don’t know if I’m on facebook lock or something, but if I am at least tell me instead of leaving me guessing. On the other hand, I don’t even know why I’d be on lock. But anyway. I don’t know if it’s just me but it doesn’t seem like it’s a universal thing. Please help.

You must individually look up and share each group, which is cumbersome and takes far more steps/time. My child is a brand Rep, and it used to be so convenient to make our promotion post and share in 5-10 groups with a few quick taps. Now, I have to individually share the post to each individual group. I understand it is probably some kind of safety feature to prevent hackers and bots and bugs, but it has really made it more difficult for us. Also, the new layout on the computer (not the app, but the physical website) has me all sorts of lost and confused. I’m a pretty tech-y person, but when you move everything from its relative location, it makes it much more difficult of an interface to use. Love the new avatars though!!! They are super fun and cute!!!

One of the more recent updates, however, made it so when someone called you through the app, it would act as a phone call on your phone. This is an issue with maybe privacy, but also while you’re using the app. Since calls are so spammable in DMs or Group DMs, the call screen will appear on your phone and disappear rapidly. While on the calling screen, you cannot do anything other than accept or decline the call. This is an issue because that basically makes it so if someone spam calls you, you can’t do anything until they stop. If you go to block them, it will take much too long. Other than this issue, the developers are pretty good about fixing bugs within the app. Also, if I’m listening to music when I join a call and then leave, my music will have messed up audio after.","One of the more recent updates, however, made it so when someone called you through the app, it would act as a phone call on your phone.",4,True,general,phone call,112.0,122.0,positive,4

I have to restart the app every time I change my pfp.The stream audio quality on mobile periodically worsens until words are unintelligible before fixing itself. Exiting and rejoining both the stream and call don’t fix this chronic issue.I also have issues during calls where I can’t hear the person I’m calling and vice versa. Discord has also kicked both of us from the call before but still shown each other as in the call. (aka each person sees themselves and the other in the call, when in reality both have been kicked and do not know it)The biggest pain is that the app overall is has become laggier. The lag has worsened since the UI change adding the gift button and send button animation from a while ago. Simple tasks like sending messages, getting the interface to show so I can unmute while watching someone’s stream, are a chore since I have to wait so long for Discord to do it’s thing. (5+ seconds. This may not sound like much but time it using a timer and imagine waiting that long for every process to load while you’re in a call)Lastly, Discord also seems to be battery hungry.

I know that a lot of people upload stuff, so the fact that it crashes as often as it does is a major concern for me. Another issue is that the app has decided to randomly mark all messages in random chat channels as read when I open them, even though I’ve still got dozens to read before I reach the end of the string. Or I’ll be reading the messages, and suddenly it marked all messages as read, to include ones that happen while I’m reading, and not even remotely caught up. It happens randomly, so I don’t even know what might be the issue. It might happen to a chat every time I open it, or just once in a while but it’s a bug I want to see gone. Being tagged in a message, and then having that indicator removed randomly is an issue. I don’t always have time to read everything in one sitting, so I want to be assured that I can read it later.

The same chosen virtual numbers, call history and messages, number of credits purchased, and the same userID, which the derive from the parting of the email address before @.

And for all users, better stay away from these schemers. There is number of the same apps which work more reliably and are honest, while this one would end up steeling your money. I have used for years and highly recommend the following alternatives:1. Sideline (can work via Wi-Fi and via cellular network, i.e. in a “calling card” mode, but you receive calls too. Extremely useful is you happen to be away from Wi-Fi)    It pays for U.S. calls with ads, but you can block all adds on iPhone/iPad (not just in Safari) with AdGuard, Adblocker Mobile and number of others2.

TextFree voiceNot to mention Skype, which supports many virtual call out numbers, and you get 60 international minutes free every month, if you pay for $98 for MS Office, plus 1T on OneDriveOr Google HangOuts, just first set up Google Voice and get a virtual number. They charge $20 (I think) for changing the number, so it’s not a “burner number” app, neither are those I have mentioned here.

The app doesn’t store your personal information, and only people you approve as contacts can message you. As with an increasing number of internet services like Google and Facebook, WhatsApp uses two-factor authentication, which has you type in a second passcode sent to your phone via text message to access your account.

This is a very desired feature for writers and professional chats. Messages can show they were “edited” or even show edit history if it’s a concern. But having the option to fix typos and misspellings is so key.3. Chat color choices - offer more than just light green bubble choices. Offer a wide range of colors (including gradients) as a fun feature that allows for customization. 4. Reactions - allow a set of reactions to messages including heart, thumbs up and down, and possibly some basic emojis. This makes communication much more efficient.I hope the developers will seriously consider adding all of these features!

Oh, and users have been asking for it for years: the developers clearly aren't very responsive to their client base.  Other than that, your choice of views are dim gray text on a white background or white text on a dark gray background.  Both are hard to read, especially if you have vision problems or are using night filters on your device.  Text cannot be zoomed in on or made larger, making it even harder for people with less-than-perfect eyesight to read. With the other problems listed for the text, if you have to use Dischord, you basically have to use speech-to-text to type and have your device read the incoming messages. Not ideal if you're trying to have a private chat in a public place.  Finally, there's no notification on the app icon telling you that you have messages waiting for you, so you have to open the app to check.

The app doesn’t store your personal information, and only people you approve as contacts can message you.

After the call integration update,- I drop calls more easily due to it being difficult to navigate outside of the app whilst staying in call. - I have a hard time returning to discord using the “touch to return to call” banner because it takes me to the actual iPhone call screen which just says “Discord Audio Connecting...” even if I’m already in call. - If i get another call on my iPhone, it kicks me out of the discord call (I was able to stay in the call before) and it’s difficult to get back in. Furthermore, if my phone call is longer than five minutes, the user I’m in call with gets kicked out as a result of me being kicked out of the call. Additionally, In an older update the “iPhone/Speaker” function for choosing if you want your call on speaker or just to be normal volume. Even if I turn my volume all the way down on my phone, it’s so loud that everyone around me can hear because it’s just on speaker by default and I can no longer change it. Really unfortunate and forces me to use some other method to contact people when I am in public. Discord is my favorite social media app to use both on pc and mobile and the downsliding of the quality on mobile is just very frustrating and disappointing.

As I’m sure is obvious, when I do several of these posts an hour the process of copying and pasting fragments of the messages becomes tedious. Not something that I generally hate, because with how wonderful discord servers are, allowing for many channels to be set up in ways that allow role-play servers to set up several settings, the limited characters per message is far outweighed in my preference.

Streaming? You can do that. But what I love most about discord is the role system in each server and earning them. It really makes you have a great time and stand out online.

But the mobile version is missing quite a few important features. For example, Discord on mobile (possibly IOS only) doesn't have Audit Logs for server moderation. Audit Logs are very important for server moderation, so that is one flaw with the mobile app. Also, only a minor setback this is, is the fact that there is no emote button on the mobile app. Yes, you can easily tap the emoji button on your keyboard, but if you are in a server with global emotes, you have to type out the names of the emote. But, there is emote prediction, making this a minor set back. Finally, I want to mention this weird bug that happens sometimes; It is a bug when you can't join Voice Channels or Voice Calls; it just disconnects you automatically, and it does this for a loop. When you close the app and retry, the same results will happen. You usually have to wait hours before you can join a Voice Channel or Voice Call again. Thank you for making such a wonderful app!

I know that a lot of people upload stuff, so the fact that it crashes as often as it does is a major concern for me. Another issue is that the app has decided to randomly mark all messages in random chat channels as read when I open them, even though I’ve still got dozens to read before I reach the end of the string. Or I’ll be reading the messages, and suddenly it marked all messages as read, to include ones that happen while I’m reading, and not even remotely caught up. It happens randomly, so I don’t even know what might be the issue. It might happen to a chat every time I open it, or just once in a while but it’s a bug I want to see gone. Being tagged in a message, and then having that indicator removed randomly is an issue. I don’t always have time to read everything in one sitting, so I want to be assured that I can read it later.

While on the calling screen, you cannot do anything other than accept or decline the call.

However, the only issue I’ve found is that, while using discord in the background, the in-game audio is significantly reduced and there is no option given to stop discord from hogging all the audio. This is obviously a problem that gets me killed all the time in game because I cannot hear footsteps.

When discord releases a new feature and the public doesn’t use it all that much or it doesn’t work like it’s supposed to, they don’t send out hundreds of updates to fix it, ultimately making it worse. Instead, they admit that it wasn’t a good thing to add and they remove it.

Unfortunately, a security flaw was identified on the server side on Oct 10 which was swiftly fixed there, but the resolution was version gated. And the version gating is universal, not by client type. So although the mobile app has no security vulnerability itself with the current version, users are locked out until the servers can gate separately or the app gets an update.

I would say that overall the app has improved, but I think our expectations have also increased, so I continue to give it three stars.Personally, I am not having a lot of glitches where the apps shuts down, or post failed to upload. It really is a wonderful way for people to connect with one another, share their experiences, and debate social issues. My biggest complaint is that when I am writing a new post, I can only see two lines of text at any one time. It is incredibly difficult to know whether I’ve made a mistake, or not, so I end up submitting the post, and then going back to edit it at which time I can see at least an entire paragraph. It seems to me that when one is making a new post.  The text box should occupy the majority of the screen. One feature I would like to see is the ability to mark all notifications as read as one can do on a laptop version.I would also like to find someway to ensure that people can be exposed to different points of view. I fear that we all will be getting posts that we agree with if the feed is filled with posts that are similar to ones that we have liked in the past.

So leaving and coming back is only A temporary fix to the problem but happens multiple times through the call it gets to be annoying. other issues is it at times call cuts out when ppl are talking and you can’t hear what they are saying and they have to repeat their self sometimes  to understand what they are saying. seem to have connection issues so if you improve the voice chat that would be awesome being you talk to ppl all over the world be nice to be able to have a conversation without it cutting out and being able to understand what everyone is saying but when it is actually working it’s so wonderful to get to have a nice Conversation with all your friends. this goes for voice chat and also discord private calling. so if you could please look into this and fix the problem that would wonderful! thank you 😊,this goes for voice chat and also discord private calling.,4,True,effectiveness,chat,21.0,25.0,negative,1

However, there are some features on PC that you can just not access on mobile.  For example, you can't change privacy settings to turn off DMs on a certain server, which can be a struggle for people with, uh, fans.  Another thing is that you can't change somebody's role on mobile, which is very aggravating. I'm a moderator on a server and we have a specific role to give to misbehaving people which prevents them from sending messages.  But, I can only do my job as moderator if I'm on my PC, because mobile won't let me change roles.  In addition, for whatever reason, certain pictures refuse to upload, and it’s not the channel settings because it’s only with certain pictures (only on mobile).  The last thing I recommend, which is currently neither on mobile or PC, is having some version of read receipts for DMs.  I know that's probably gonna be controversial, but I personally know that some of my friends are big YouTubers, so they get caught up, and forget.  However, if I was able to tell if they'd read my message, I'd be able to yell at — er, uh, talk to them about it.","The last thing I recommend, which is currently neither on mobile or PC, is having some version of read receipts for DMs.",4,True,effectiveness,read receipt,99.0,111.0,negative,1

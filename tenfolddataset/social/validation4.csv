Some other apps allow to select the whole camera roll and update the selection afterwards if we want to change from a few photos to all photos in the phone to be allowed to be shared.Discord only has the option to “select” the photos that we want to share, instead of the whole camera roll.

You can do that. Change your display name for only one, specific server? You can do that too. But for me the most valuable thing about Discord is the sense of community that you feel almost immediately after logging on. Depending on your server choices you’ll almost always have an unread message, meaning there’s almost always something or someone for you to come back to. And if you don’t want to be bothered? Turn off notifications for servers and channels you don’t want to hear from. Not once have I had a security issue or even fear that I would lose personal information.

Discord has fixed so many bugs in the past and I’m glad the Dev’s are active and actually do their best to fix issues. I remember a time when if a message was copied from discord to word, then it’d have a black background and it’d be annoying to remove on word. But now that’s no longer an issue.

I personally disprove of this update, as every time someone actually calls me outside of the discord app, I have to end my own discord call instwad of it holding in the background after I finish speaking with whomever called me.To the creators of discord, I highly suggest you either 1. Remove callkit completely, or 2. Give us a setting option to turn it off, so that we have private calling, and so it DOES NOT DISPLAY ON MY LOCK SCREEN, (its irritating.)If those changes dont happen, I feel discord will lose quite a bit of its users and people will start to have a slight change its its direction of functioning better and heading on the right path.","Give us a setting option to turn it off, so that we have private calling, and so it DOES NOT DISPLAY ON MY LOCK SCREEN, (its irritating.)",1,True,effectiveness,setting,11.0,18.0,negative,1

Very frustrating when you’ve been looking at something for a long time only for it to close and then the newsfeed refreshes and you’ve lost the link you were looking at originally. None of the other apps (Pinterest, Instagram) do this. Their back/forward buttons are at the bottom of the screen, away from the “X” button so you don’t risk closing your page.

It’s basically like iMessaging but it offers a calling system as well. I personally love this app and I’ve been using it for about a year now. You can do some exploring and find servers that you like and/or find new interests! As an example I took up knitting as an inspiration to make a gift for an online friend. Though Discord does have safety and privacy settings, it is wise to keep your personal information to yourself while talking with online friends. Discord will not leak your information to any of your friends or anyone at all, so it’s entirely up to you if you want to share anything (such as time zones). I don’t recommend sharing personal information, especially when you’ve just met them. Be careful when messaging unknown users.Again, I love Discord and would definitely recommend it.

Why is it that the computer, laptop, PC program of Discord allows a share screen tab and not the mobile? I understand that it may be difficult to add features like so, but this just seemed like common sense. As a mobile artist, I would like to share my work progress with my friends and others. I do not use computer programs therefore I cannot share my screen to show my artwork process. This would be a very convenient and nice feature to add and I assure you it would be used regularly by friends, artists, businesses, etc.Thank you for your time and I do hope you consider my recommendation.As a side note, Discord works incredibly well!

I can easily upload the largest files when using on my computer, but a SCREENSHOT cannot even be posted from my phone.also sometimes there’s a delay in the notifications ?
